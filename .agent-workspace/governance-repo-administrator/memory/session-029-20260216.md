# Session 029 - 20260216 (Living Agent System v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: governance-repo-administrator
- Class: administrator
- Session ID: copilot-swe-20260216-define-delivery-standard

## Task
Define explicit "fully functional" delivery standards and strengthen wave gates to prevent incomplete deliverables. Address critical governance gap where production-grade frontend applications were explicitly required at every governance checkpoint but never delivered—waves closed with only backend/tests built despite requirements.

## What I Did

### Files Modified (Auto-populated)
- `governance/canon/FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md` (NEW - 28905 bytes, SHA256: 7a71beefcc7eab51f99cb8d0865585cf4a6450304e9cf1ae07dfa4deb731d69c)
- `governance/foreman-agent-contract.md` (UPDATED - added delivery verification requirements)
- `governance/canon/WAVE_MODEL.md` (UPDATED - added Fully Functional Delivery references)
- `governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json` (UPDATED - added new standard, updated total_canons to 158)
- `GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md` (UPDATED - documented new standard)
- `governance/CHANGELOG.md` (UPDATED - added comprehensive change entry with migration guidance)

### Actions Taken

1. **Wake-Up Protocol Execution**
   - Executed `.github/scripts/wake-up-protocol.sh governance-repo-administrator`
   - Verified CANON_INVENTORY integrity (157 canons, HEALTHY status)
   - Loaded last 5 session memories
   - Generated working contract

2. **Governance Analysis**
   - Reviewed existing governance canon structure
   - Analyzed BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md One-Time Build Law
   - Analyzed WE_ONLY_FAIL_ONCE_DOCTRINE.md
   - Analyzed ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETENESS_REQUIREMENTS.md
   - Analyzed WAVE_MODEL.md wave closure requirements
   - Analyzed BUILD_EFFECTIVENESS_STANDARD.md
   - Identified gap: no explicit "fully functional" definitions

3. **Canon Creation**
   - Created FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md (v1.0.0)
   - Defined three core normative definitions:
     - Fully Functional Design (Section 3.1)
     - Fully Functional App (Section 3.2)
     - Fully Functional Delivery (Section 3.3)
   - Established wave gate strengthening requirements (Section 4)
   - Defined PM & Foreman contract requirements (Section 5)
   - Defined enforcement mechanisms (Section 6)
   - Addressed MAT retroactive compliance (Section 8)
   - Integrated with related canon (Section 7)

4. **Contract Updates**
   - Updated `governance/foreman-agent-contract.md`:
     - Architecture-First Enforcement: Added Fully Functional Design validation
     - Task Delegation: Added physical deliverable verification
     - QA Enforcement: Added critical rule "Tested" ≠ "Delivered"
     - New section: Wave Closure & Fully Functional Delivery
     - Canon Management: Added standard enforcement reference
     - Prohibitions: Added wave authorization and closure restrictions
   - Updated `governance/canon/WAVE_MODEL.md`:
     - Section 9.3 Wave Closure: Added deliverable verification requirements
     - Section 10 Prohibitions: Added deliverable existence checks
     - Section 12 Integration: Added FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md reference

5. **Inventory Updates**
   - Added new canon to CANON_INVENTORY.json (entry 158)
   - Calculated SHA256 hash: 7a71beefcc7eab51f99cb8d0865585cf4a6450304e9cf1ae07dfa4deb731d69c
   - Updated total_canons from 157 to 158
   - Updated timestamps to 2026-02-16T11:36:37Z
   - Added entry to GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md

6. **Change Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive CHANGELOG.md entry
   - Documented affected artifacts (6 files)
   - Provided migration guidance for consumer repositories
   - Documented impact on Foreman, Builders, PM, and wave processes
   - Linked to authority sources and related canon

### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Create new Tier-1 Canon vs. updating existing files
   - **Rationale**: Gap is fundamental enough to warrant dedicated canonical standard. Integrates multiple related canons (BUILD_PHILOSOPHY, WE_ONLY_FAIL_ONCE, ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETENESS) into cohesive operational standard.
   - **Authority**: Self-alignment per REQ-AS-001 (new canon creation within bounds)

2. **Decision**: Make standard PUBLIC_API layer-down status
   - **Rationale**: All consumer repositories must implement to prevent recurrence. Standard affects wave authorization/closure processes universally.
   - **Authority**: REQ-RA-001 (constitutional canon changes trigger layer-down ripple)

3. **Decision**: Update Foreman contract directly vs. create separate guidance
   - **Rationale**: Foreman has non-delegable authority for wave authorization and closure. Standard obligations must be in contract for enforcement.
   - **Authority**: Self-alignment per REQ-AS-001 (contract updates within scope)

4. **Decision**: Include MAT retroactive compliance section
   - **Rationale**: Standard created in response to MAT failure. Must address immediate remediation to demonstrate learning and prevent production release with incomplete deliverables.
   - **Authority**: WE_ONLY_FAIL_ONCE_DOCTRINE.md Section 5 (learning promotion workflow)

5. **Decision**: Define three separate "fully functional" concepts
   - **Rationale**: Gap exists at multiple stages: design (architecture), implementation (apps), and delivery (complete system). Each needs explicit definition to prevent failures.
   - **Authority**: ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETENESS_REQUIREMENTS.md Section 2 (foundational principle)

6. **Decision**: Strengthen wave gates vs. just documentation
   - **Rationale**: Documentation alone insufficient (proven by MAT failure). Requires structural enforcement at authorization and closure gates per WE_ONLY_FAIL_ONCE_DOCTRINE.md Section 3.2.
   - **Authority**: WE_ONLY_FAIL_ONCE_DOCTRINE.md (mandatory structural change)

## Lessons

### What Worked Well

1. **Comprehensive Canon Review First**
   - Reviewing BUILD_PHILOSOPHY, WE_ONLY_FAIL_ONCE, and ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETENESS before writing new standard ensured proper integration and authority foundation
   - Prevented creating conflicting or redundant guidance

2. **Three-Level Definition Structure**
   - Separating "Fully Functional" into Design, App, and Delivery levels provided clarity at each stage
   - Each level has distinct validation criteria and gate requirements
   - Addresses gap at architecture, implementation, and delivery phases

3. **Explicit Prohibition Patterns**
   - Section 11 "Prohibited Patterns" provides clear examples of unacceptable behaviors
   - "Tested" ≠ "Delivered" messaging is memorable and actionable
   - Foreman and PM know exactly what NOT to do

4. **Concrete Enforcement Mechanisms**
   - Section 6 provides automated detection, manual checklists, and postmortem protocols
   - Not just "thou shalt" but "here's how to enforce"
   - Bridges governance intent to operational reality

5. **MAT Retroactive Compliance Section**
   - Directly addresses the triggering failure with remediation requirements
   - Demonstrates "learning from failure" in action
   - Provides template for future retroactive compliance

### What Was Challenging

1. **Balancing Specificity vs. Generality**
   - Standard must be specific enough to prevent MAT-like failures but general enough to apply to all applications
   - Solution: Concrete definitions with "completeness test" questions for each level
   - Challenge: Finding right abstraction level for diverse application types

2. **Determining Self-Alignment vs. CS2 Escalation Boundary**
   - New canon creation is significant governance change
   - Decision: Self-align with clear rationale and CS2 approval pending
   - Rationale: Gap is operational (wave gates) not constitutional (governance philosophy)
   - Authority model worked correctly but required careful reasoning

3. **Integration Complexity**
   - Standard touches multiple canons: BUILD_PHILOSOPHY, WE_ONLY_FAIL_ONCE, ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETENESS, WAVE_MODEL, BUILD_EFFECTIVENESS
   - Solution: Section 7 "Integration with Related Canon" provides explicit mapping
   - Challenge: Ensuring no conflicts or circular dependencies

4. **Migration Guidance Scope**
   - PUBLIC_API ripple means all consumers must update
   - Solution: Comprehensive migration guidance in CHANGELOG.md
   - Challenge: Anticipating all consumer repository variations

### What Future Sessions Should Know

1. **"Fully Functional" Now Canonical**
   - Use FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md definitions in all contexts
   - Reference sections explicitly when discussing design/app/delivery completeness
   - Standard is PUBLIC_API - all repositories must comply

2. **Wave Gates Now Stricter**
   - Pre-authorization: Architecture must be Fully Functional Design (Section 3.1)
   - Pre-closure: ALL deliverables must exist and work (Section 3.3)
   - Certificate issuance requires evidence bundle per Section 4.3

3. **"Tested" ≠ "Delivered" is Core Principle**
   - Passing tests necessary but not sufficient for wave closure
   - Physical, working deliverables MUST exist
   - This prevents repeat of MAT failure mode

4. **Foreman Authority and Obligations**
   - Foreman MUST verify deliverables before closure (non-delegable)
   - Foreman MUST launch/deploy apps to verify they work
   - Foreman MUST NOT close waves with missing deliverables
   - Contract updated with explicit prohibitions

5. **Ripple Execution Required**
   - This change requires layer-down ripple to all consumers
   - Migration guidance in CHANGELOG.md Section
   - Foreman and PM training required in consumer repositories

6. **Standard as Learning Example**
   - Section 8 (MAT Retroactive Compliance) demonstrates learning capture
   - Standard itself is product of WE_ONLY_FAIL_ONCE_DOCTRINE.md
   - Gap → Analysis → Canon → Enforcement → Prevention

### Governance Insights

1. **Governance Gaps Have Operational Symptoms**
   - MAT frontend missing = governance gap, not builder failure
   - Symptom: "Tests pass" accepted as "complete" without deliverable verification
   - Root cause: No explicit definition of "fully functional"
   - Resolution: Canonical standard with enforceable gates

2. **Explicit Definitions Prevent Ambiguity**
   - "Fully functional" was assumed to be understood
   - Assumption enabled partial delivery acceptance
   - Solution: Normative definitions with completeness test questions
   - Principle: If not explicit in governance, it's not enforceable

3. **Wave Gates Need Both Documentation and Enforcement**
   - Wave closure requirements existed but not enforced
   - Documentation alone insufficient to prevent failures
   - Solution: Structural enforcement (gates, checklists, prohibitions, certificates)
   - Principle: Governance without enforcement is advisory

4. **Self-Alignment Authority Model Working as Designed**
   - Governance-repo-administrator exercised self-alignment authority correctly
   - Clear rationale provided for new canon creation
   - CS2 approval pending in PR review (proper escalation)
   - Demonstrates autonomy with accountability

5. **Constitutional Integration Critical**
   - Standard derives authority from BUILD_PHILOSOPHY and WE_ONLY_FAIL_ONCE
   - Links to ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETENESS and WAVE_MODEL
   - Integration section prevents orphan guidance
   - Principle: New governance must link to existing governance explicitly

6. **Learning Promotion in Action**
   - MAT failure → Gap analysis → Canon creation → Ripple
   - Demonstrates WE_ONLY_FAIL_ONCE_DOCTRINE.md workflow
   - Structural change prevents recurrence
   - Validates governance evolution through execution reality
