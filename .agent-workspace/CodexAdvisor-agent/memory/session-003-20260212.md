# Session 003 - 20260212 (Living Agent System v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: CodexAdvisor-agent
- Class: overseer
- Session ID: session-003-20260212

## Task
CS2-authorized self-review and alignment operation:
1. Locate required checklist artifacts
2. Inspect governance inventory alignment
3. Verify checklist coverage for all agent types
4. Perform gap analysis between checklists, inventory, and agent files
5. Fix version regressions (v5.0.0 → v6.2.0)
6. Create missing checklists if needed
7. Update/align agent files to Living Agent System v6.2.0

## What I Did

### Files Modified (Auto-populated)
- `.github/agents/CodexAdvisor-agent.md` - SHA256: [updated with v6.2.0 references]
- `governance/checklists/CODEX_ADVISOR_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md` - SHA256: [created]
- `governance/checklists/FOREMAN_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md` - SHA256: [created]
- `governance/checklists/GOVERNANCE_LIAISON_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md` - SHA256: [created]
- `governance/checklists/BUILDER_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md` - SHA256: [created]

### Actions Taken

#### 1. Repository Analysis
- Explored repository structure to locate agent files, CANON_INVENTORY, and checklist artifacts
- Identified three agent files in `.github/agents/`:
  - CodexAdvisor-agent.md
  - foreman-v2.agent.md
  - governance-repo-administrator-v2.agent.md
- Located CANON_INVENTORY at `governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json` (canonical source, not `.governance-pack/`)
- Confirmed no `governance/checklists/` directory existed

#### 2. Gap Analysis Findings
- **Critical Version Bug**: CodexAdvisor-agent.md contained v5.0.0 references in session memory template (lines 132, 154, 191)
- **Missing Checklists**: All four required checklist files were missing
- **CANON_INVENTORY Status**: ✅ All PUBLIC_API entries have full 64-character SHA256 hashes (no placeholders)
- **Character Counts**: All agent files well under 30K limit:
  - CodexAdvisor: 21,586 chars
  - Foreman: 15,636 chars
  - Governance-repo-administrator: 14,624 chars

#### 3. Version Regression Fix
- Updated three v5.0.0 references to v6.2.0 in CodexAdvisor-agent.md:
  - Line 132: Session memory template header
  - Line 154: Living Agent System Evidence section
  - Line 191: Authority footer
- Verified all three agent files now consistently use v6.2.0

#### 4. Checklist Creation
Created four comprehensive checklists in `governance/checklists/`:

**CODEX_ADVISOR_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md** (10,267 chars)
- 9 mandatory components
- 56 requirements (REQ-CM-001 through REQ-AG-004)
- 5 validation hooks (VH-001 through VH-005)
- Agent-factory specific requirements
- 30K character limit enforcement
- Version consistency validation

**FOREMAN_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md** (9,092 chars)
- All 10 requirement categories
- Foreman-specific requirements (builder supervision, QA ownership, architecture-first)
- Merge Gate Interface ownership
- Zero-test-debt enforcement
- Prohibitions section
- Validation requirements

**GOVERNANCE_LIAISON_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md** (12,196 chars)
- All 56 requirements explicitly mapped
- Governance-specific capabilities (CANON_INVENTORY, ripple, merge gates, protected files)
- Evidence preservation protocol
- Security and validation capabilities
- Prohibitions section

**BUILDER_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md** (11,209 chars)
- Universal builder requirements
- Build-to-Green commitment
- Prehandover proof requirements
- Architecture-first acknowledgment
- Foreman supervision requirements
- Specialty-specific requirements (UI/API/Schema/Integration/QA)
- Quality gates and evidence requirements

#### 5. Validation Performed
- ✅ Character counts: All files < 30,000 (GitHub UI selectability)
- ✅ Version consistency: All v6.2.0, no v5.0.0 references
- ✅ CANON_INVENTORY: No placeholder/truncated PUBLIC_API hashes
- ✅ Checklist paths: Match agent file references exactly
- ✅ All checklists include Living Agent System v6.2.0 compliance
- ✅ All checklists include CS2 authority declaration

### Decisions Made

#### Decision 1: .governance-pack Understanding
**What**: Clarified that this repository is the canonical governance source
**Why**: This is `maturion-foreman-governance` (canonical home), not a consumer repo. The `.governance-pack/` structure would exist in consumer repositories where governance is layered down, not here.
**Action**: No need to create `.governance-pack/` in this repository

#### Decision 2: Comprehensive Checklist Coverage
**What**: Created all four agent type checklists, not just CodexAdvisor
**Why**: Issue requested coverage for "both the foreman and governance agents" but comprehensive coverage ensures future agent creation is properly validated
**Action**: Created checklists for CodexAdvisor, Foreman, Governance Liaison, and Builder

#### Decision 3: Checklist Format and Structure
**What**: Used existing `BUILDER_CONTRACT_BINDING_CHECKLIST.md` as template
**Why**: Maintains consistency with existing governance artifacts and provides machine-checkable validation format
**Action**: Structured all checklists with sections, requirements, validation criteria, severity levels, and authority declarations

#### Decision 4: Version Consistency Enforcement
**What**: Fixed v5.0.0 → v6.2.0 in session memory template only
**Why**: Other v5.0.0 references were in legacy archives or workspace artifacts not part of active agent contracts
**Action**: Focused surgical fix on CodexAdvisor-agent.md active contract file

## Living Agent System v6.2.0 Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: This session memory file
- Status: Complete - All planned actions executed successfully

### Ripple Status
- Status: No ripple required
- Ripple required: NO
- Reason: Internal repository improvements; checklists are new governance artifacts that enhance validation but do not change constitutional canon semantics

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: Critical gaps addressed
- Gaps closed:
  1. Missing checklists (4 created)
  2. Version regression (fixed)
  3. Checklist directory structure (created)
  4. Agent validation capability (enabled)

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: Improved
- Issues detected and fixed:
  - Version consistency restored (v5.0.0 → v6.2.0)
  - Checklist artifacts now present for agent validation
  - All agent files verified under 30K character limit
  - CANON_INVENTORY confirmed healthy (no placeholder hashes)

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

All CS2-authorized tasks successfully executed:
1. ✅ Located checklist artifacts (none existed, created all)
2. ✅ Inspected governance inventory (healthy, no placeholder hashes)
3. ✅ Verified checklist coverage (comprehensive for all agent types)
4. ✅ Performed gap analysis (found version bug, missing checklists)
5. ✅ Fixed version regression (v5.0.0 → v6.2.0)
6. ✅ Created missing checklists (4 comprehensive checklists)
7. ✅ Validated agent file compliance (all passing)

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
1. **Systematic Analysis**: Starting with repository exploration provided clear gap identification
2. **Parallel File Creation**: Creating all four checklists in sequence maintained consistency
3. **Evidence-First Validation**: Character counts, version checks, and hash validation confirmed compliance
4. **Template Reuse**: Using existing BUILDER_CONTRACT_BINDING_CHECKLIST.md as reference ensured format consistency

### What Was Challenging
1. **Comprehensive Requirements**: Capturing all 56 Living Agent System v6.2.0 requirements across multiple agent types required careful cross-referencing
2. **Character Budget**: Balancing comprehensive coverage with 30K character limit required concise writing
3. **Scope Clarity**: Understanding .governance-pack vs governance/ directory usage required analysis of canonical home metadata

### What Future Sessions Should Know
1. **Checklist Maintenance**: When Living Agent System requirements evolve, all four checklists must be updated in sync
2. **Version Vigilance**: Always verify version consistency across all agent files and templates
3. **Character Count Validation**: Run `wc -m` validation before any agent file PR
4. **Governance-Pack Context**: This repository is canonical source; .governance-pack is for consumer repos only

### Governance Insights
1. **Checklist Infrastructure**: Having machine-checkable checklists enables automated agent validation and prevents non-compliant agent recruitment
2. **Version Regression Risk**: Session memory templates are easy places for version drift; should be validated in CI/CD
3. **Character Limit Importance**: 30K GitHub UI selectability is critical governance constraint that must be enforced in agent creation
4. **Canonical Source Clarity**: Clear canonical_home metadata prevents confusion about governance artifact location

## Next Steps
- Run wake-up protocol to validate working contract generation
- Consider adding CI/CD validation for:
  - Agent file character counts
  - Version consistency checks
  - Checklist reference validation
- Update CANON_INVENTORY to include new checklist artifacts (if they qualify as PUBLIC_API)
