## Agent
- Type: governance-repo-administrator
- Class: administrator
- Session ID: copilot-agent-session-050-20260224

## Task
Expand Universal 'We Only Fail Once' Preflight/Registry Policy to ALL Agents (Not Foreman Only).
Issue: APGI-cmy/maturion-foreman-governance#1196 (CS2 — Johan Ras | 2026-02-24)

## What I Did
### Files Created (New)
- `governance/canon/UNIVERSAL_FAIL_ONLY_ONCE_POLICY.md` v1.0.0 — SHA256: 9ae5d4f0638dc3c2424982b9947e307d404034c99c6a32b6f151399084e9ef1c
- `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/knowledge/FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md` — Per-agent breach registry for CodexAdvisor
- `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/knowledge/index.md` — Tier 2 knowledge index
- `.agent-workspace/governance-repo-administrator/knowledge/FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md` — Per-agent breach registry for governance-repo-administrator
- `.agent-workspace/governance-repo-administrator/knowledge/index.md` — Tier 2 knowledge index
- `.agent-workspace-template/knowledge/FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md` — Template stub for new agents
- `.agent-workspace-template/knowledge/index.md` — Template knowledge index

### Files Modified (Updated)
- `.github/agents/CodexAdvisor-agent.md` — Added §1.3 FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Attestation; renumbered §1.3→1.4 Canonical Governance Bindings
- `.github/agents/governance-repo-administrator-v2.agent.md` — Added §1.3 FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Attestation; renumbered §1.3→1.4 Canonical Governance Bindings
- `governance/canon/agent-contracts-guidance/templates/AGENT_CONTRACT.template.md` — Added mandatory FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Preflight Attestation section
- `governance/canon/agent-contracts-guidance/AGENT_ONBOARDING_QUICKSTART.md` — Added Failure Prevention subsection in Step 3
- `.agent-workspace-template/README.md` — Added `knowledge/` directory to structure documentation
- `governance/CHANGELOG.md` — Added UNIVERSAL-FAIL-ONLY-ONCE-POLICY entry
- `governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json` — Added entry 180, updated total_canons: 179→180, last_updated: 2026-02-24

### Actions Taken
- Action 1: Created `UNIVERSAL_FAIL_ONLY_ONCE_POLICY.md` defining universal applicability, per-agent vs shared registry, format requirements, preflight mandate, CodexAdvisor/liaison enforcement obligations
- Action 2: Updated CodexAdvisor and governance-repo-administrator agent contracts with §1.3 FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Attestation
- Action 3: Seeded per-agent FAIL-ONLY-ONCE registries with domain-appropriate Universal and Conditional rules
- Action 4: Updated AGENT_CONTRACT.template.md so all new agents inherit the requirement
- Action 5: Updated AGENT_ONBOARDING_QUICKSTART.md with universal FAIL-ONLY-ONCE requirement
- Action 6: Added knowledge/ directory to .agent-workspace-template with FAIL-ONLY-ONCE stub
- Action 7: Updated CHANGELOG and CANON_INVENTORY per governance protocol

### Decisions Made
- Decision 1: Per-agent registries for all agents (not a single shared registry) because each agent class has domain-specific failure modes; cross-cutting failures are promoted via FAILURE_PROMOTION_RULE.md
- Decision 2: Inserted FAIL-ONLY-ONCE attestation as §1.3 in Phase 1 (matching foreman pattern), renumbering Canonical Governance Bindings to §1.4 — preserves consistency across all four-phase contracts
- Decision 3: Minimum 4 universal seed rules in template (A-01 through A-04) — applies to any agent regardless of class; additional class-specific rules seeded in live agent registries
- Decision 4: Enforced via AGENT_CONTRACT.template.md and AGENT_ONBOARDING_QUICKSTART.md so CodexAdvisor can validate presence on every new agent PR

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence: CHANGELOG entry created with full artifact list and SHA256 hash
- Status: COMPLETE

### Ripple Status
- Status: REQUIRED — PUBLIC_API canon change
- Ripple required: YES — layer-down to all 4 consumer repositories per GOVERNANCE_RIPPLE_MODEL.md
- Note: Ripple issue creation deferred to layer-down dispatch workflow execution

### Governance Gap Progress
- Gap addressed: FAIL-ONLY-ONCE policy was Foreman-only — now universal across all agent classes

### Governance Hygiene
- CANON_INVENTORY updated (entry 180)
- SHA256 hash computed and recorded
- CHANGELOG entry created with full provenance
- Session memory created

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

## Lessons
### What Worked Well
- Four-phase agent contract structure made the insertion of §1.3 FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Attestation clean and consistent across all agents

### What Was Challenging
- Ensuring domain-appropriate rules in per-agent registries while keeping the universal minimum requirements consistent

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- When creating new agent contracts, always create the knowledge/ directory with FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md before creating the agent file — CodexAdvisor now validates this as BLOCKING
- Consumer repo layer-down still needed for this change (ripple dispatch to all 4 consumers)

### Governance Insights
- The three-tier knowledge architecture (THREE_TIER_AGENT_KNOWLEDGE_ARCHITECTURE.md) already had the structure for this; FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md as a Tier 2 knowledge artifact is the correct canonical location
