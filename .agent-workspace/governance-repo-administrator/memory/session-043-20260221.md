### Actions Taken
1. **Created `governance/canon/ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY.md` v1.0.0**: Tier-2 living canon with canonical definitions for all 13 required terms (orchestrate, implement, review, evaluate, quality assurance, build, 100% build, escalate, canonize, fully functional, living agent, wave, governance gap). Includes Mode Reference Table mapping verbs to FM operating modes.
2. **Updated `foreman-v2.agent.md` (v2.0.0→v2.1.0)**:
   - Added ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY.md to `expected_artifacts` in YAML frontmatter
   - Added `ecosystem_vocabulary` to `metadata` in YAML frontmatter
   - Added ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY.md to Canonical Governance Bindings (Section 1.3)
   - Added Section 1.5: Verb Classification Gate (executable bash script — FM_H priority)
   - Added Section 1.6: Mode-Switching Protocol (3 modes with executable scripts)
   - Added ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY.md to Canonical Governance References at bottom
   - Updated `last_updated` to 2026-02-21, `contract_version` to 2.1.0
3. **Updated `governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json`**: Added ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY entry with full SHA256 hash, total_canons 181→182.
4. **Updated `GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md`**: Added new ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY entry and updated last-updated date.
5. **Updated `governance/CHANGELOG.md`**: Added [ECOSYSTEM-VOCAB-FOREMAN-MODALITIES] entry at the top of Change History.
6. **Created ripple log**: `governance/ripple/RIPPLE-ECOSYSTEM-VOCAB-FOREMAN-MODALITIES-20260221.md` documenting layer-down requirements for all 4 consumer repos.

### Decisions Made
1. **Tier-2 (not Tier-1) for ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY.md**: The vocabulary document is operational canon (Tier-2) rather than constitutional (Tier-1), since it is a living document that grows as the ecosystem evolves. This is consistent with the THREE_TIER_AGENT_KNOWLEDGE_ARCHITECTURE.md classification.
2. **Quality Professor as FM mode (not separate agent)**: Per the issue requirements, Quality Professor is a mode that the Foreman switches into, not a separate agent. This keeps the architecture clean and avoids new agent creation (which would require CS2-gated bundle per AGENT_CREATION_BUNDLE_REQUIREMENTS.md).
3. **Executable scripts for mode logic**: Per the issue requirement "All modal/verb logic must be script/enforceable, not prose only" — added bash scripts for each mode in Section 1.6 and for the Verb Classification Gate in Section 1.5.
4. **Contract version bump 2.0.0→2.1.0**: Minor version bump for additive (non-breaking) changes to the foreman contract.
5. **ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY.md as PUBLIC_API**: Layer-down to all consumer repos is mandatory since all agent contracts must reference it.

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- CHANGELOG entry recorded: [ECOSYSTEM-VOCAB-FOREMAN-MODALITIES] 2026-02-21
- CANON_INVENTORY updated with SHA256 hashes
- GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY synchronized
- Ripple log created

### Ripple Status
- Status: PENDING LAYER-DOWN (ripple log created, consumer repo issues to be opened after PR merge)
- Ripple required: YES (PUBLIC_API status, 4 consumer repos)
- Ripple log: `governance/ripple/RIPPLE-ECOSYSTEM-VOCAB-FOREMAN-MODALITIES-20260221.md`

### Governance Gap Progress
- This session CLOSES the governance gap identified in issue: missing canonical vocabulary and unformalized Foreman modalities

### Governance Hygiene
- No protected constitutional canon modified without CS2 approval
- CS2 approval was explicit in the issue (platform owner APGI-cmy)
- All changes are PR-only (no direct main push)
- CANON_INVENTORY integrity maintained (no placeholder hashes added)

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Clear CS2 authorization in the issue made it straightforward to proceed
- Parallel file creation (ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY.md and foreman contract updates) was efficient
- Following existing CHANGELOG format kept entries consistent

### What Was Challenging
- Finding the exact insertion point in GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md alphabetically
- Keeping the foreman contract Phase numbering consistent (inserted 1.5 and 1.6 before PHASE 2)

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY.md is the authoritative vocabulary source — always reference it in new agent contracts
- The Verb Classification Gate (Section 1.5) is FM_H priority — it runs before any task execution
- Quality Professor MUST be invoked before every handover — this is now a constitutional requirement
- Consumer repo ripple issues need to be opened after PR merge for all 4 consumer repos

### Governance Insights
- Adding a vocabulary document early resolves ambiguity that otherwise leads to governance gap escalations
- Making mode logic executable (not just prose) provides a testable, deterministic foundation
- Separating Quality Professor strictly from builder modes prevents the common pattern of FM self-fixing
