# Session 002 - 20260211 (Living Agent System v5.0.0)

## Agent
- Type: CodexAdvisor-agent
- Class: Governance advisor / overseer
- Session ID: 002

## Task
Create a gold-standard foreman-v2 agent contract (per PR #1095 reference) and archive the prior template, while recording evidence and session memory updates (Fixes #1096).

### Actions Taken
- Ran wake-up protocol (`.github/scripts/wake-up-protocol.sh CodexAdvisor-agent`) — missing contract noted (degraded start).
- Authored `.github/agents/foreman-v2.agent.md` aligned to governance-repo-administrator-v2 (LAS v6.2.0, zero-test-debt, memory/evidence/escalation).
- Archived legacy foreman template to `.github/agents/legacy/foreman-v5.0.0-archive.md`.
- Logged change record in `.agent-admin/changes/change_007_20260211.md`.
- Updated CodexAdvisor lessons/patterns to capture degraded wake-up and agent-contract creation flow.

### Decisions Made
- Proceeded in degraded mode due to missing CodexAdvisor contract to unblock CS2-authorized work; documented in memory.
- Used governance-repo-administrator-v2 structure as canonical template to ensure compliance across 10 requirement categories.

## Living Agent System v5.0.0 Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: `.agent-admin/changes/change_007_20260211.md`
- Status: Documented creation/archive steps and compliance notes; session memory recorded.

### Ripple Status
- Status: No ripple triggered (contract update in governance repo).
- Ripple required: NO

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: Missing CodexAdvisor agent contract persists; noted for follow-up/escalation if needed.

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: Operating via PR-only writes; zero-test-debt enforcement documented; no workflow/canon changes made. CodexAdvisor remains on LAS v5.0.0 while producing a LAS v6.2.0 foreman contract (version boundary acknowledged).

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

## Lessons
### What Worked Well
- Leveraging the governance-repo-administrator-v2 structure accelerated compliant foreman contract drafting.
- Early change-record capture kept evidence aligned with LAS requirements.

### What Was Challenging
- Wake-up failed due to absent CodexAdvisor contract, requiring degraded-mode operation.
- Ensuring zero-test-debt and merge-gate obligations were translated without over-editing the template.

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- Confirm agent contracts exist before wake-up to avoid degraded start; escalate if missing.
- Reusing gold-standard agent files as scaffolding reduces risk when authoring new contracts.

### Governance Insights
- Contract updates must bundle evidence and session memory to remain LAS-compliant.
- Managerial (foreman) contracts still require merge-gate, evidence, and escalation rigor identical to administrators.
