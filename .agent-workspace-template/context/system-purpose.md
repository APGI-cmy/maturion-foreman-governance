# System Purpose

## What We're Building

**Maturion Foreman Application** - A governed AI-powered application execution system.

## Core Components

### Foreman (FM)
- Orchestrates multiple builders
- Manages application execution workflow
- Ensures zero test debt through governance
- Maintains constitutional compliance

### Builders
- Execute specific tasks under Foreman direction
- Follow governance canon for quality
- Report status and metrics to Foreman
- Operate within defined boundaries

### Governance System
- Constitutional documents define quality standards
- Canonical governance repository (this repo) is source of truth
- Ripple system propagates changes to consumer repositories
- Living Agent System enables continuous improvement

## Key Principles

1. **Zero Test Debt**: Tests are created and maintained perpetually
2. **Constitutional Governance**: All work follows canonical governance
3. **Living Agents**: Agents learn, remember, and improve across sessions
4. **Quality First**: Governance gates ensure standards before execution

## Agent Role in System

Agents are not just executors—they are:
- **Learners**: Build knowledge across sessions
- **Coordinators**: Escalate and handoff intelligently
- **Guardians**: Enforce governance and detect drift
- **Improvers**: Capture patterns and propose enhancements

## Success Metrics

- Zero test debt maintained
- Governance compliance verified
- Agent memory accumulated and utilized
- Cross-session learning demonstrated
- Quality gates passed consistently
