## Example

### 2026-02-06 - Memory Gitignored Incorrectly

**Context**: Setting up agent workspace structure

**Mistake**: Initially gitignored entire .agent-workspace/ directory

**Root Cause**: Misunderstood ephemeral vs persistent requirements in canon

**Remedy**: Only gitignore working-contract.md and environment-health.json; commit all memory, personal, context, escalation files

**Impact**: Lost all session memories and cross-session learning capability
