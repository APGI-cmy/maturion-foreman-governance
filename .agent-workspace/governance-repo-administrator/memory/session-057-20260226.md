# Session 057 - 20260226 (Living Agent System v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: governance-repo-administrator
- Class: administrator
- Session ID: 057

## Task
Resolve issue: [Governance Canon] Formalize unique per-wave artifact filenames for agent session records (PREHANDOVER, memory, etc.)

Specifically: Update `FOREMAN_WAVE_PLANNING_AND_ISSUE_ARTIFACT_GENERATION_PROTOCOL.md` to add a mandatory naming convention requiring both session ID and wave/subwave ID in all per-wave session record artifact filenames, preventing session ID collision when multiple waves execute in a single foreman session/date.

## What I Did

### Files Modified
- `governance/canon/FOREMAN_WAVE_PLANNING_AND_ISSUE_ARTIFACT_GENERATION_PROTOCOL.md` — Bumped to v1.1.0; added §5.3 (Session Record Artifact Naming Convention), updated §8.1 (compliance checklist) and §10 (summary), updated version history
- `governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json` — Updated hash/version/effective_date for the protocol file; bumped `last_updated` to 2026-02-26
- `governance/CHANGELOG.md` — Added entry `[WAVE-ARTIFACT-NAMING-001] - 2026-02-26`
- `.agent-workspace/governance-repo-administrator/ripple-log.md` — Added ripple history entries and ripple details section for WAVE-ARTIFACT-NAMING-001

### Actions Taken
- Action 1: Read the full FOREMAN_WAVE_PLANNING protocol to understand its structure and find the right insertion point
- Action 2: Added §5.3 with mandatory naming rule, filename pattern, canonical examples table, scope (all agent classes), and backward-compatibility note
- Action 3: Updated §8.1 mandatory requirements checklist to reference §5.3
- Action 4: Updated §10 summary to add per-wave naming Q&A entry
- Action 5: Bumped version header, versioning section, and footer to v1.1.0 / 2026-02-26
- Action 6: Computed new SHA256 and updated CANON_INVENTORY.json
- Action 7: Added CHANGELOG entry with full rationale, migration guidance, and ripple notice
- Action 8: Added ripple history lines and detailed ripple section in ripple-log.md covering all 4 consumer repos

### Decisions Made
- Decision 1: Placed naming convention in §5.3 (under Wave Progress Artifact Requirements) rather than §8 (Compliance) to keep it close to the artifact creation context; §8.1 cross-references it
- Decision 2: Named the section "Session Record Artifact Naming Convention" to be inclusive of PREHANDOVER proofs, session memory, gate results, and RCA files
- Decision 3: Added "Backward Compatibility" sub-section explicitly prohibiting retroactive renames to avoid history corruption
- Decision 4: Cross-referenced AGENT_HANDOVER_AUTOMATION.md and FOREMAN_MEMORY_PROTOCOL.md (not edited — those require separate CS2-approved ripple updates in consumer repos)

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: CHANGELOG entry WAVE-ARTIFACT-NAMING-001 records all affected artifacts
- Status: Complete — canon updated, CANON_INVENTORY hash updated, CHANGELOG entry added, ripple log updated

### Ripple Status
- Status: RIPPLE REQUIRED — all 4 consumer repos notified in ripple-log.md
- Ripple required: YES — FOREMAN_WAVE_PLANNING protocol is PUBLIC_API; consumer repo agent contracts (foreman, QA, IAA) must be updated
- Ripple issues to be created post-merge by CodexAdvisor per protocol

### Governance Gap Progress
- No new gaps identified

### Governance Hygiene
- CANON_INVENTORY hash updated; no placeholder hashes introduced

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- The §5 artifact requirements section was the natural home for the naming convention
- A table of canonical examples makes the rule unambiguous for all agent types

### What Was Challenging
- Ensuring backward compatibility language was explicit so agents don't rename historical files

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- Ripple issues must be created in all 4 consumer repos after this PR merges; CodexAdvisor should be instructed to update foreman, QA, and IAA contract checklists in each repo
- The parking station Learning L-004 should be marked resolved once ripple is complete

### Governance Insights
- Session ID collision is a systemic risk whenever multiple waves run in one session; making the naming convention explicit in the canonical protocol is the correct fix rather than relying on agent memory
