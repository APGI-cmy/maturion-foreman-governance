# CODEOWNERS - Governance Guardrail
# 
# This file defines ownership rules for critical governance and infrastructure files.
# These paths require explicit human (Johan) approval before merging.
#
# Purpose: Prevent Foreman from modifying core governance, CI/CD, or architectural
# safeguards without human oversight.

# NOTES FOR JOHAN
# =============================================================================
#
# These paths are now protected. Foreman can:
# - Open PRs that modify these files
# - Request reviews for these changes
#
# Foreman CANNOT:
# - Merge PRs affecting these paths without your approval
# - Bypass CODEOWNERS protection
# - Modify branch protection rules
#
# When Foreman opens a PR touching these paths:
# 1. GitHub will automatically request your review
# 2. PR cannot be merged until you approve
# 3. This applies even if all CI checks pass
#
# To grant approval:
# 1. Review the PR changes carefully
# 2. Click "Review changes" > "Approve" in GitHub UI
# 3. PR becomes mergeable after your approval
#
