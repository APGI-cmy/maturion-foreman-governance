# Governance Scan — Pre-Implementation Behavior Review Protocol Layerdown

**Timestamp**: 2026-01-14T08:05:00Z  
**Repository**: APGI-cmy/maturion-foreman-governance (CANONICAL GOVERNANCE SOURCE)  
**Agent**: Agent Contract Administrator  
**Purpose**: Pre-work governance discovery for Pre-Implementation Behavior Review Protocol layerdown task

---

## Repository Context

**Current Repository**: maturion-foreman-governance  
**Repository Type**: Canonical governance source (source of truth for all governance)  
**Branch**: copilot/update-governance-agent-files  
**Commit SHA**: bca851e

**Agents in This Repository**:
1. `governance-repo-administrator` - Governance repository administrator
2. `CodexAdvisor` - Advisory agent  
3. `agent-contract-administrator` - This agent (self)

**Local Governance Path**: `governance/`  
**Canonical Source**: THIS REPOSITORY (at the source)

## Issue Analysis

**Issue**: Layer down and update governance agent files for Pre-Implementation Behavior Review Protocol

**Key Requirements**:
1. The protocol files referenced in the issue DO NOT EXIST yet:
   - `governance/canon/PRE_IMPLEMENTATION_BEHAVIOR_REVIEW_PROTOCOL.md` - NOT FOUND
   - `governance/templates/PRE_IMPLEMENTATION_BEHAVIOR_REVIEW_REPORT.template.md` - NOT FOUND

2. The issue references `governance/profiles/builder.v1.md` which EXISTS and already has enhancement capture requirements (Section 11)

**Interpretation**: This appears to be asking to:
- Either CREATE the protocol files first, then layer them down
- OR reference protocol files that should exist but don't (blocker)

## Canonical Governance Documents Discovered

### Tier-0 Constitutional Documents
- `governance/CONSTITUTION.md` - Supreme constitutional authority
- `governance/manifests/tier_0_manifest.json` - Tier-0 governance manifest

### Relevant Canon Documents for This Task

**Enhancement & Improvement Governance**:
- `governance/canon/MANDATORY_ENHANCEMENT_CAPTURE_STANDARD.md` v2.0.0 - Mandatory enhancement and process improvement capture (CURRENT STANDARD)
- `governance/canon/LEARNING_INTAKE_AND_PROMOTION_MODEL.md` - Learning preservation requirements
- `governance/canon/LEARNING_PROMOTION_RULE.md` - Learning promotion process

**Agent Contract & Recruitment**:
- `governance/canon/AGENT_RECRUITMENT.md` - Agent legitimacy and authority
- `governance/canon/AGENT_RECRUITMENT_AND_CONTRACT_AUTHORITY_MODEL.md` - Recruitment authority framework
- `governance/canon/AGENT_CONTRACT_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md` - Contract modification authority (prohibits self-modification)
- `governance/canon/AGENT_ONBOARDING_QUICKSTART.md` - Unified agent onboarding

**Execution & Handover**:
- `governance/canon/EXECUTION_BOOTSTRAP_PROTOCOL.md` v2.0.0+ - Pre-handover validation requirements
- `governance/templates/PREHANDOVER_PROOF_TEMPLATE.md` v2.0.0 - Handover proof template

**Ripple & Layer-Down**:
- `governance/canon/GOVERNANCE_RIPPLE_MODEL.md` - Ripple propagation protocol
- `governance/canon/CROSS_REPOSITORY_LAYER_DOWN_PROTOCOL.md` - Cross-repo governance propagation

---

## Agent Files Requiring Updates

**In this repository (.github/agents/)**:
1. `governance-repo-administrator.agent.md` v2.2.0 - Governance repository administrator
2. `CodexAdvisor-agent.md` - Advisory agent
3. `agent-contract-administrator.md` v2.1.0 - This agent (self-modification PROHIBITED)

**Profiles (governance/profiles/)**:
1. `builder.v1.md` v1.2 - Builder governance profile (already has Section 11 for enhancement capture)
2. `reviewer.v1.md` - Reviewer profile (may need updates)

**Note**: The issue mentions "builder, FM, governance, Codex" agents - but there are NO FM agents or other builder agents IN THIS REPOSITORY. Those exist in consumer repositories (office-app, etc.).

---

## Current Enhancement Governance

**Current Standard**: `MANDATORY_ENHANCEMENT_CAPTURE_STANDARD.md` v2.0.0 (2026-01-08)

**Current Requirements**:
- Mandatory enhancement capture AFTER work completion
- Both feature AND process improvement reflection required
- 5 mandatory process reflection questions
- Parking station routing for enhancements
- Prohibition on proactive implementation

**Gap**: There is NO PRE-IMPLEMENTATION review protocol for enhancements that are AUTHORIZED for execution. The current standard only covers:
1. Post-work enhancement CAPTURE (parking)
2. Prohibition on proactive implementation

**Missing**: Protocol for reviewing parked enhancements BEFORE authorizing implementation (which is what this issue appears to be requesting)

---

## Governance Gaps Identified

1. **Missing Protocol Files**: The files referenced in the issue do not exist
   - `PRE_IMPLEMENTATION_BEHAVIOR_REVIEW_PROTOCOL.md` - NOT FOUND
   - `PRE_IMPLEMENTATION_BEHAVIOR_REVIEW_REPORT.template.md` - NOT FOUND

2. **Scope Ambiguity**: The issue asks to update "builder, FM, and governance agent profiles" but:
   - NO FM agents exist in THIS repository (they're in consumer repos)
   - NO builder agents exist in THIS repository (builder.v1.md is a PROFILE, not an agent)
   - Only 3 agents exist here: governance-repo-administrator, CodexAdvisor, agent-contract-administrator

3. **Layer-Down Target Unclear**: Should this protocol be:
   - Created in canon FIRST, then layered down?
   - Already exist elsewhere and be imported?
   - Be created as part of this task?

---

## Constitutional Principles Identified

From scanned governance documents:

1. **Build Philosophy**: Architecture → QA → Build → Validation (BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md)
2. **Zero Test Debt**: No suppression, no skipping, 100% passage
3. **100% Handovers**: Complete work or escalate blocker
4. **No Warning Escalations**: Warnings are errors
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Post-job suggestions mandatory
6. **Agent Self-Awareness**: Must know identity, location, purpose, repository
7. **Autonomous Operation**: Full authority within governance sandbox
8. **Non-Coder Environment**: Governance-first, code-second
9. **Change Management**: Governance before file changes
10. **Specialization**: Domain-specific, escalate cross-domain
11. **Repository Awareness**: Know which repo, which agents, which governance applies
12. **Contract Modification Prohibition**: Agents MUST NOT modify their own contracts

---

## Decision

**BLOCKER IDENTIFIED**: The referenced protocol files do not exist in the repository, and the issue scope is ambiguous regarding which agents need updates.

**Recommended Actions**:
1. Clarify with issue author (CS2/Johan) whether:
   - Protocol files should be created first as part of this task
   - Protocol files exist elsewhere and need to be imported
   - Issue is premature and protocol creation should happen first

2. Clarify which agents need updates:
   - Only agents IN THIS REPO (governance-repo-administrator, CodexAdvisor)?
   - Consumer repo agents (FM, builders in office-app) via layer-down instruction?

**Alternative Interpretation**: Perhaps the issue is asking me to CREATE the protocol based on the enhancement capture standard, THEN layer it down. This would be a significant governance creation task requiring CS2 authorization.
