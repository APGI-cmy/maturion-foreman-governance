# Session 007 - 20260227 — IAA Agent Contract Creation (Living Agent System v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: CodexAdvisor-agent
- Class: overseer
- Session ID: session-007-20260227-iaa-contract
- Contract version loaded: 3.2.0

## Task

Create the Independent Assurance Agent (IAA) agent contract file
(`.github/agents/independent-assurance-agent.md`) per issue:
"[CodexAdvisor] Create Independent Assurance Agent (IAA) and Tier 1/2 artifacts as per isms
precedent and PR #1213".

Referenced requirements:
- Create `.github/agents/independent-assurance-agent.md` adapted for governance context
- Codify Tier 1 artifacts: agent contract, identity, constitutional alignment
- Tier 2 artifacts already exist from merged PR #1213 (iaa-core-invariants-checklist.md v1.1.0,
  iaa-category-overlays.md v1.2.0, FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md v1.0.0, session-memory-template.md v1.1.0)
- Adopt improvements from PR #1213 (learning loop, recurring shortfall codification)
- Deliver with all supporting artifacts

## What I Did

### Files Created

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `.github/agents/independent-assurance-agent.md` v1.0.0 (contract v1.0.0) | IAA Tier 1 agent contract — 22,068 characters |
| `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/memory/session-007-20260227.md` | This session memory |
| `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/memory/PREHANDOVER-session-007-20260227.md` | PREHANDOVER proof |

### Tier 2 Artifacts Status (from PR #1213 — already present)
- `.agent-workspace/independent-assurance-agent/knowledge/index.md` v1.1.0 ✅
- `.agent-workspace/independent-assurance-agent/knowledge/iaa-core-invariants-checklist.md` v1.1.0 ✅
- `.agent-workspace/independent-assurance-agent/knowledge/iaa-category-overlays.md` v1.2.0 ✅
- `.agent-workspace/independent-assurance-agent/knowledge/FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md` v1.0.0 ✅
- `.agent-workspace/independent-assurance-agent/memory/session-memory-template.md` v1.1.0 ✅
- `.agent-workspace/independent-assurance-agent/memory/session-001-20260226.md` ✅
- `.agent-workspace/independent-assurance-agent/escalation-inbox/` ✅

### Decisions Made

**Decision 1 — YAML frontmatter iaa_oversight block: required: false**
- Rationale: The IAA cannot assure its own contract changes — independence violation per IAA Canon
  §Independence Requirements rule 4. CS2 is the sole approval authority. `iaa_oversight.required`
  set to false with explicit CS2-only authority stated. This is structurally correct and follows
  the IAA Canon's mandate that only CS2 may update the IAA agent file.
- Alternative rejected: Setting `required: true` would be circular — the IAA cannot be its own
  assurance body. CS2 direct approval is the appropriate governance model for IAA contract changes.

**Decision 2 — lock_id SELF-ASSURANCE-001 and SELF-MOD-IAA-001 (two distinct locks)**
- Rationale: The IAA needs two distinct locks: one preventing self-modification (same as other
  agents), and one specifically preventing self-assurance (unique to IAA role as independence
  enforcer). Two lock IDs make this separation explicit and machine-readable.
- Alternative rejected: Single lock — would conflate two distinct prohibition categories.

**Decision 3 — Phase 3 assurance execution references Tier 2 checklists by path (not inline)**
- Rationale: Per CodexAdvisor non-negotiables, Tier 2 content must never be inlined in the
  contract. The phase scripts reference `iaa-core-invariants-checklist.md` and
  `iaa-category-overlays.md` by name/path only. All actual checklist content stays in Tier 2.
- Alternative rejected: Inlining checklist items would violate the Tier architecture and grow
  the contract beyond the 30,000 char limit.

**Decision 4 — Contract size: 22,068 characters (within 25,000 preferred limit)**
- Rationale: The IAA has a complex operational model (5-phase assurance, 8 invariant sections,
  6 overlays) but all checklist content lives in Tier 2. Contract size stays within limits by
  referencing Tier 2 knowledge rather than duplicating it.

**Decision 5 — model: claude-sonnet-4-5 (same as governance-repo-administrator-v2)**
- Rationale: The IAA performs assurance reasoning (not agent file creation), aligning better with
  the administrator model than the CodexAdvisor overseer model. claude-sonnet-4-5 is appropriate.
- Alternative rejected: claude-sonnet-4-6 (CodexAdvisor's model) — CodexAdvisor is the agent
  factory; IAA is an assurance agent. Different roles, same model tier acceptable.

## IAA Trigger Classification
- PR category: Core agent file creation (`.github/agents/` path)
- IAA required: YES — per IAA Canon trigger table
- IAA advisory phase: PHASE_A_ADVISORY — IAA not yet deployed as live agent
- Note: This PR creates the IAA contract itself. Per IAA Canon §Independence Requirements rule 4,
  only CS2 may approve IAA contract changes. IAA cannot self-assure this PR.
  IAA assurance is PHASE_A_ADVISORY; CS2 is the sole approval authority.

## OPOJD Gate
- YAML validation: PASS ✅ (file parses cleanly — no duplicate keys, correct structure)
- Character count: 22,068 / 30,000 ✅ (within 25,000 preferred limit)
- Checklist compliance: all applicable gates met ✅
- Canon hash verification: PASS ✅ (no CANON_INVENTORY changes; existing hashes unchanged)
- No placeholder/stub/TODO content: ✅
- No embedded Tier 2 content: ✅ (all checklist content in Tier 2 `.agent-workspace/`)
- No hardcoded version strings in phase body text: ✅ (agent reads versions from YAML and Tier 2)
- OPOJD: PASS ✅

## Merge Gate Parity
- merge-gate/verdict: PASS ✅ (PREHANDOVER proof artifact present)
- governance/alignment: PASS ✅ (no CANON_INVENTORY changes, no placeholder hashes introduced)
- stop-and-fix/enforcement: PASS ✅ (no open blockers in workspace)
- Merge gate parity: PASS

## Roles Invoked
- CodexAdvisor-agent (this session)

## Agents Created or Updated
- independent-assurance-agent (new, contract v1.0.0)

## Escalations Triggered
none

## IAA Invocation Result
PHASE_A_ADVISORY — IAA not yet deployed as live assurance agent. Per IAA Canon §Independence
Requirements rule 4, this PR (creating the IAA contract itself) cannot be self-assured by IAA.
CS2 is the sole approval authority. Flagged for IAA review once Phase B activates.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. **INTEGRITY_INDEX.md should be updated with IAA agent contract baseline once CS2 approves
   this PR.** The governance/quality/agent-integrity/INTEGRITY_INDEX.md does not yet include an
   entry for `independent-assurance-agent.md`. Per IAA Canon §Agent Integrity Obligations §4,
   once the IAA contract is instantiated, CS2 should add its baseline SHA256 to INTEGRITY_INDEX.md
   and add a copy to `governance/quality/agent-integrity/independent-assurance-agent.md`.

2. **governance/quality/agent-integrity/independent-assurance-agent.md reference copy should be
   created.** All other agent contracts have a reference copy in the integrity store. Once this
   PR is merged and CS2 approves, the reference copy should be committed to the integrity store.

## Parking Station
All suggestions logged to `.agent-workspace/parking-station/suggestions-log.md`.

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE — IAA Tier 1 agent contract created. Tier 2 artifacts confirmed present from PR #1213.
All required bundle artifacts delivered.

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Tier 2 artifacts from PR #1213 provided complete operational knowledge for the contract to
  reference — no gaps in the knowledge store
- The INDEPENDENT_ASSURANCE_AGENT_CANON.md v1.0.0 provided comprehensive behavioral specs,
  making the phase scripts straightforward to write from canon requirements

### What Was Challenging
- The iaa_oversight block requires special handling since IAA cannot self-assure — needed
  explicit documentation of the CS2-only approval pathway
- Ensuring the contract does not inline Tier 2 content while still providing sufficient
  operational direction in the phase scripts

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- The IAA INTEGRITY_INDEX.md entry should be the first CS2-driven update after this PR merges
- The CANON_INVENTORY.json does not track Tier 2 `.agent-workspace/` files — this is by design
- Once the IAA is active (Phase B), it becomes the final assurance gate for all qualifying PRs

### Governance Insights
- The IAA having two distinct locks (SELF-MOD-IAA-001 for contract modification, SELF-ASSURANCE-001
  for independence) reflects the unique dual-constraint nature of the assurance class
- The Phase A → Phase B adoption strategy (from INDEPENDENT_ASSURANCE_EXECUTION_STRATEGY.md) is
  important — the IAA operates in advisory mode until Phase B activates
