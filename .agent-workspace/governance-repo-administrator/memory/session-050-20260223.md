- Session ID: 050-20260223

## Task
Implement governance canon for mandatory Pre-Build Reality Check gate per issue APGI-cmy/maturion-foreman-governance#459.

## What I Did

### Files Modified

| File | Change | SHA256 (after) |
|------|--------|----------------|
| `governance/canon/PRE_BUILD_REALITY_CHECK_CANON.md` | NEW v1.0.0 | 0e3296398d33d95ea56ee944b4ade17c60bd93dd2e0885f32f5d15e725ee49cd |
| `governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json` | Added entry; total_canons 178→179 | (updated) |
| `governance/canon/LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md` | Added §2.5 Pre-Build Reality Check Gate section | (updated) |
| `.github/agents/foreman-v2.agent.md` | Added Phase 2.5 between PHASE 2 and PHASE 3 | (updated) |
| `governance/CHANGELOG.md` | Added [PRE-BUILD-REALITY-CHECK-CANON] entry | (updated) |
| `governance/ripple/RIPPLE-PRE-BUILD-REALITY-CHECK-CANON-20260223.md` | NEW — ripple evidence | (new) |

### Actions Taken

1. Explored repository structure — verified CANON_INVENTORY, CHANGELOG format, existing canon patterns, foreman-v2 agent structure
2. Created `governance/canon/PRE_BUILD_REALITY_CHECK_CANON.md` v1.0.0 — full canon with §4.3 checklist, gap handling, evidence requirements, retroactive mandate, prohibitions, and layer-down requirements
3. Computed SHA256 hash of new canon: `0e3296398d33d95ea56ee944b4ade17c60bd93dd2e0885f32f5d15e725ee49cd`
4. Updated `governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json` — added entry at correct alphabetical position (index 125, between POST_MORTEM_PROTOCOL.md and PRE_IMPLEMENTATION_BEHAVIOR_REVIEW_PROTOCOL.md), updated total_canons and last_updated
5. Updated `governance/canon/LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md` — added §2.5 Pre-Build Reality Check Gate section in Agent Lifecycle section between §2 Working Phase and §3 Session Closure Phase
6. Updated `.github/agents/foreman-v2.agent.md` — inserted PHASE 2.5 block between end of PHASE 2 and start of PHASE 3
7. Updated `governance/CHANGELOG.md` — added versioned entry [PRE-BUILD-REALITY-CHECK-CANON] as most recent entry
8. Created `governance/ripple/RIPPLE-PRE-BUILD-REALITY-CHECK-CANON-20260223.md` — ripple evidence artifact with layer-down plan and issue template

### Decisions Made

- **Decision**: Used `layer_down_status: PUBLIC_API` for the new canon entry — Rationale: the issue explicitly requires ripple to all consumer repos; PUBLIC_API is the correct status for canons that must propagate.
- **Decision**: Inserted Phase 2.5 in foreman-v2.agent.md rather than modifying Phase 3 — Rationale: the issue asks for an explicit phase between alignment/induction and ticket/build generation; inserting as a named phase preserves the four-phase contract structure while adding the gate.
- **Decision**: §2.5 in LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md scoped to Foreman only — Rationale: the canon specifies Foreman-led; other agent types do not need this section in LAS.
- **Decision**: Reality Check Log immutability modeled after existing evidence immutability principle (REQ-ER-001).

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- CANON_INVENTORY.json updated with full SHA256 hash (REQ-CM-001) ✅
- Provenance and effective_date recorded (REQ-CM-002) ✅
- CHANGELOG.md updated with versioned entry (REQ-CR-001) ✅
- Ripple evidence artifact created (REQ-RA-003) ✅
- No direct main push; PR-only write (REQ-SS-003) ✅

### Ripple Status
- Status: INITIATED
- Ripple required: YES (PUBLIC_API layer_down_status)
- Ripple evidence: `governance/ripple/RIPPLE-PRE-BUILD-REALITY-CHECK-CANON-20260223.md`
- Consumer repo issues: PENDING (Governance Administrator to create per layer-down plan in ripple report)

### Governance Gap Progress
- Issue #459 resolved: Pre-Build Reality Check gate canonized and integrated into Foreman contract and LAS

### Governance Hygiene
- CANON_INVENTORY total_canons updated to 179
- No placeholder hashes introduced

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE — All primary deliverables from issue #459 implemented

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Parallel file exploration before making changes gave clear picture of correct insertion points
- Computing SHA256 before updating CANON_INVENTORY ensured hash accuracy
- Using Python for JSON update avoided formatting issues

### What Was Challenging
- Foreman agent file is 1150 lines; careful grep required to find correct insertion point for Phase 2.5

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- When inserting a new canon with PUBLIC_API layer_down_status, always create a corresponding ripple report in `governance/ripple/`
- The CHANGELOG.md entry for a new canon should reference the SHA256 hash for traceability
- CANON_INVENTORY.json uses alphabetical ordering; always compute the correct insertion index

### Governance Insights
- The four-phase Foreman contract pattern (PHASE 1-4) is extensible; PHASE 2.5 pattern was established by this session as a precedent for inter-phase gates
