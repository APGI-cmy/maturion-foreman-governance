- `GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md` (UPDATED - 3 new canon entries documented)

### Actions Taken
1. Explored repository: identified 3 missing canon docs, existing architecture patterns, checklist format
2. Created THREE_TIER_AGENT_KNOWLEDGE_ARCHITECTURE.md: defines Tier 1/2/3 structure, knowledge acquisition protocol, staleness detection, storage layout, consumer repo references
3. Created AGENT_CREATION_BUNDLE_REQUIREMENTS.md: 5-component bundle spec, completeness gate, integration point table, consumer references
4. Created PROXY_AUTHORITY_MODEL.md: explicit proxy language pattern, scope rules, verification protocol for Foreman/CodexAdvisor/all agents, lifecycle table
5. Updated ORCHESTRATOR_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md: added Section 4 (bundle requirements) and Section 5 (proxy authority pre-check), bumped to v1.1.0
6. Updated SPECIALIST_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md: added Section 4 (bundle requirements) and Section 5 (proxy authority pre-check), bumped to v1.1.0
7. Updated CANON_INVENTORY.json: added 3 entries with full SHA256 hashes (no placeholders), updated total_canons and last_updated
8. Updated CHANGELOG.md: added [CANON-3TIER-BUNDLE-PROXY] entry with all affected artifacts, SHA256s, migration guidance
9. Updated GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md: added all 3 new canon entries in alphabetical order

### Decisions Made
- Decision 1: THREE_TIER canon aligned with existing SPECIALIST_KNOWLEDGE_MANAGEMENT.md (which already defined Tier 1/2/3 for specialists) — extended to all agent classes
- Decision 2: PROXY_AUTHORITY_MODEL extends CS2_AGENT_FILE_AUTHORITY_MODEL.md Level 3 rather than replacing it — additive, not breaking
- Decision 3: Checklist updates are purely additive (Sections 4+5) — no existing section modified, backward compatible
- Decision 4: Consumer repo references (#360, #362, #361) included in all 3 new docs per issue requirement

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- CANON_INVENTORY.json updated with full SHA256 hashes (no placeholders) ✅
- All 3 new docs linked to each other and to existing canon ✅
- Checklists updated with mandatory sections for bundle and proxy ✅
- CHANGELOG and GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY updated ✅

### Ripple Status
- Status: Layer-down ripple to consumer repos required (all 3 new docs are PUBLIC_API)
- Ripple required: YES — CANON_INVENTORY.json updated with 3 new PUBLIC_API entries
- Consumer repos affected: maturion-foreman-office-app, PartPulse, R_Roster, maturion-isms
- Note: Ripple to be executed after PR merge per standard protocol

### Governance Gap Progress
- Closed gap: No canonical 3-tier knowledge architecture definition → THREE_TIER_AGENT_KNOWLEDGE_ARCHITECTURE.md v1.0.0
- Closed gap: No formal agent creation bundle spec → AGENT_CREATION_BUNDLE_REQUIREMENTS.md v1.0.0
- Closed gap: No canonical proxy authority model → PROXY_AUTHORITY_MODEL.md v1.0.0
- Closed gap: Checklists didn't require bundle or proxy verification → updated to v1.1.0

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: All changes are additive canon (no breaking changes to existing documents)
- CANON_INVENTORY.json: no placeholder hashes (all full 64-char SHA256) ✅
- PR-only writes: no direct push to main ✅
- CS2 authorization: present in issue authority statement ✅

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Existing SPECIALIST_KNOWLEDGE_MANAGEMENT.md already had Tier 1/2/3 definitions — could reference and extend rather than redefine
- Additive-only checklist changes (new sections) preserved all existing compliance without migration burden
- CS2_AGENT_FILE_AUTHORITY_MODEL.md already had the 5-level hierarchy — PROXY_AUTHORITY_MODEL just added the mechanism for Level 3 temporary elevation

### What Was Challenging
- Needed to verify that GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md doesn't have programmatic generation (it's maintained by hand — safe to edit)
- Alphabetical insertion in GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md required careful location finding for P (PROXY) and T (THREE_TIER)

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- THREE_TIER_AGENT_KNOWLEDGE_ARCHITECTURE.md and AGENT_CREATION_BUNDLE_REQUIREMENTS.md should be referenced in agent contract templates (ORCHESTRATOR_AGENT_TEMPLATE.md, SPECIALIST_AGENT_TEMPLATE.md) in a future session
- Layer-down ripple to all 4 consumer repos should be executed after this PR merges
- PREHANDOVER_PROOF_TEMPLATE.md could be updated to include bundle compliance check in a future session (not required for this issue)

### Governance Insights
- The 3-tier model was implicit in SPECIALIST_KNOWLEDGE_MANAGEMENT.md but not platform-wide canonical. This session made it canonical for all agent classes.
- Proxy authority was operationally used but not canonically defined — now locked in with explicit language requirements
- Bundle completeness as a "gate" concept is powerful: it prevents "zombie" agents (contract exists but agent is not operational)
