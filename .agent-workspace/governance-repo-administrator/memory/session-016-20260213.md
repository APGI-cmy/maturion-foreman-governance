   - Updated canonical flow diagram to include TRS
   - Updated ordering rule to include TRS

3. **governance/templates/BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER_TEMPLATE.md** (NEW)
   - SHA256: `070d3345e0b3904e8b14fcb8a3dde745cd2dca5787c3e275c9355283e2c8e1f4`
   - New template for tracking module lifecycle progress

4. **governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json** (UPDATED)
   - Added 2 new entries, updated 1 existing
   - Total canons: 153 (was 151)
   - All entries include full SHA256 checksums

5. **GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md** (UPDATED)
   - Added new strategy section
   - Updated policy entry with TRS details
   - Updated template entry with TRS stage

6. **governance/CHANGELOG.md** (UPDATED)
   - Added comprehensive TRS governance layer-up entry
   - Documented breaking change classification
   - Included migration guidance and impact assessment

### Actions Taken
- Action 1: Executed wake-up protocol per REQ-AS-005
- Action 2: Retrieved and validated source files from maturion-isms with SHA256 checksums
- Action 3: Created governance/strategy/ directory (new structural addition)
- Action 4: Layered-up three governance files from maturion-isms
- Action 5: Updated CANON_INVENTORY.json with full SHA256 checksums and provenance
- Action 6: Updated GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md with new entries
- Action 7: Updated governance/CHANGELOG.md with full change documentation
- Action 8: Validated JSON syntax and markdown files
- Action 9: Requested and completed code review (1 non-blocking comment)
- Action 10: Ran CodeQL security scan (no code changes to analyze)

### Decisions Made
- Decision 1: Created new governance/strategy/ directory as it didn't exist - this is a structural enhancement
- Decision 2: Used exact SHA256 checksums from maturion-isms evidence package for validation
- Decision 3: Classified change as MODERATE BREAKING CHANGE due to new mandatory stage, but maintained backward compatibility through incremental adoption
- Decision 4: Updated CANON_INVENTORY with layer_down_status: PUBLIC_API for all three files (strategy, policy, template)
- Decision 5: Documented comprehensive migration path in CHANGELOG for consumer repositories

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: All changes committed in 3 git commits
- Status: Complete with full SHA256 validation
- Wake-up protocol: Executed successfully
- Session closure: Pending (this memory creation)

### Ripple Status
- Status: Layer-up complete, layer-down ripple required
- Ripple required: YES - Layer-down to 4 consumer repositories
- Ripple scope: maturion-isms (confirmation), maturion-foreman-office-app, PartPulse, R_Roster
- Ripple mechanism: governance-ripple-dispatch.yml workflow triggers after merge

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: No gaps detected during layer-up
- Gap addressed: Closed governance gap between FRS and Architecture by introducing TRS stage
- Impact: Prevents downstream implementation failures due to missing technical specifications

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: All governance requirements followed
- Hygiene issues detected: None
- Validation: JSON syntax validated, markdown files created successfully
- Code review: Completed with 1 non-blocking comment
- Security scan: Completed (no code changes)

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

Layer-up successfully executed with full compliance to Living Agent System v6.2.0 requirements:
- REQ-CM-001/002: CANON_INVENTORY with full SHA256 and provenance ✅
- REQ-RA-001: Constitutional canon change documented for layer-down ripple ✅
- REQ-RA-002: Inventories updated with canon changes ✅
- REQ-AS-001: Self-aligned governance documentation within bounds ✅
- REQ-CR-001: CHANGELOG updated ✅
- REQ-EO-001/002/003: Validation completed ✅
- REQ-EO-006: Code review completed ✅
- REQ-SS-004: Security scan completed ✅
- REQ-ER-003: Session memory created (this file) ✅

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Lesson 1: Wake-up protocol provided excellent context and environment health check at session start
- Lesson 2: SHA256 checksum validation against source evidence package ensured file integrity
- Lesson 3: Layer-up protocol from maturion-isms was well-documented with complete evidence package
- Lesson 4: Creating governance/strategy/ directory as new structure was straightforward and logical
- Lesson 5: CANON_INVENTORY Python script update approach was efficient and maintainable

### What Was Challenging
- Challenge 1: Initial file creation with `create` tool failed due to timing issue with directory creation - resolved by using bash cat/heredoc
- Challenge 2: Understanding the full context of the layer-up request required reading multiple documents (issue, layer-up doc, source files)
- Challenge 3: Ensuring all inventory files were synchronized required careful attention to detail

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- Recommendation 1: Always run wake-up protocol first to load agent identity and context
- Recommendation 2: For layer-up requests, validate SHA256 checksums against source evidence package
- Recommendation 3: When creating new directories, use bash mkdir first before creating files
- Recommendation 4: Update CANON_INVENTORY.json using Python script for consistency
- Recommendation 5: Always update GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md and CHANGELOG.md together
- Recommendation 6: Code review should be run before security scan (REQ-EO-006 before REQ-SS-004)

### Governance Insights
- Insight 1: TRS stage fills critical gap between functional requirements and architecture - prevents late-discovery technical failures
- Insight 2: Layer-up protocol is working well - evidence-based governance evolution is effective
- Insight 3: Breaking changes can maintain backward compatibility through incremental adoption strategies
- Insight 4: Comprehensive migration guidance in CHANGELOG is essential for consumer repository adoption
- Insight 5: SHA256 checksum validation ensures file integrity across layer-up operations
