### Title
[Governance Repo] Replace layer-down dispatch system: agent-instructed issue pipeline + delete all legacy workflows

### Body
> ⚠️ **AGENT PREFLIGHT MANDATORY** — call `agent_bootstrap` with your agent ID before reading below.

Workflow authority: `LAYERING_AND_RIPPLING_AUTOMATION_STRATEGY.md` v1.0.0

## Context

PR #1221 fixed the 5 structural gaps in the layer-down pipeline. However, the **consumer-side** pattern remains wrong: `governance-ripple-sync.yml` in consumer repos auto-creates "dump-file" PRs instead of issuing surgical agent instructions. This issue completes the redesign on the **governance repo (sender) side**.

The target design:
- Governance canonical push → `governance-layer-down-dispatch.yml` fires
- For each enabled consumer repo: creates **one issue** with full surgical agent instructions, auto-assigned to the correct `governance-liaison-{repo}-agent`
- Also sends `repository_dispatch` (`governance_ripple`) to trigger the consumer-side intake workflow
- The **agent** layers down, ripples, invokes CodexAdvisor for tier 2/3 alignment, opens a ripple PR, enables auto-merge, closes the issue
- No files are ever auto-dumped by any workflow

---

## Task

### 1. Rewrite `.github/layer-down-issue-template.md`

Replace the current generic checklist with full surgical agent instructions. The new template must include:

**Required sections:**
- Mandatory `agent_bootstrap` preflight banner (⚠️ DO NOT SKIP)
- Source repo, canonical commit SHA (`{{COMMIT_SHA}}`), short SHA (`{{SHORT_SHA}}`), timestamp (`{{TIMESTAMP}}`), commit message (`{{COMMIT_MESSAGE}}`)
- Explicit list of changed artifacts (`{{FILES_LIST}}`)
- **Phase 1** — Preflight: call `agent_bootstrap`, record session memory
- **Phase 2** — Layer Down: copy each listed canon file into this repo at the correct path; update `GOVERNANCE_ALIGNMENT_INVENTORY.json`
- **Phase 3** — Agent File Gate:
  - If any artifact is `.github/agents/*.md`: **HALT**. Create escalation doc at `.agent-workspace/governance-liaison-{repo}/escalation-inbox/agent-contract-escalation-{{SHORT_SHA}}.md`. Notify CS2. STOP.
  - If NO agent files: continue to Phase 4
- **Phase 4** — Ripple: invoke CodexAdvisor agent with explicit instruction to align tier 2/3 artifacts referencing the updated canon; update all cross-references; update `GOVERNANCE_ALIGNMENT_INVENTORY.json`; attach `PREHANDOVER_PROOF` if executable artifacts changed
- **Phase 5** — PR & Auto-Merge: open ripple PR titled `[Ripple] Layer-down {{SHORT_SHA}} — {repo}`; enable auto-merge (squash); close this issue after merge
- `{{AGENT_SECTION}}` placeholder for agent-file CS2 escalation block
- Auto-close eligibility checklist

### 2. Replace `governance/executable/workflows/consumer-alignment.yml.template`

The current template deploys `governance-ripple-sync.yml` to consumer repos (the auto-dump-PR pattern). Replace it with a new template that deploys `governance-layer-down-intake.yml` instead.

The new `governance-layer-down-intake.yml` template must:
- Trigger on `repository_dispatch: types: [governance_ripple]` and `workflow_dispatch`
- Have `permissions: contents: read, issues: write` only (no `pull-requests: write` — the agent creates PRs, not the workflow)
- Extract payload (`commit_sha`, `short_sha`, `source_repo`, `agent_files_changed`, `timestamp`)
- Check idempotency: if an open `governance`+`layer-down` issue for this commit SHA already exists, skip creation
- Bootstrap `governance` and `layer-down` labels if missing
- Create a layer-down issue (using the new template content) auto-assigned to `governance-liaison-{repo}-agent` (read liaison from `CONSUMER_REPO_REGISTRY.json` payload or hard-coded per repo)
- Post an agent activation comment on the issue with: `agent_bootstrap` command, canonical commit, agent file gate status, and the 6-step SOP
- **Do NOT** run `align-governance.sh`, create PRs, or copy any files

### 3. Delete all legacy workflows and files

Delete the following from this repo (they are superseded, wrong-pattern, or orphaned):

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `.github/workflows/qiel-template.yml.example` | Legacy QIEL template — orphaned, not part of current governance pattern |
| `.github/workflows/foreman-governance.yml` | Legacy governance policy validation — superseded by `governance-gate.yml` |
| `.github/workflows/fm-failure-enforcement-gate.yml` | Legacy build/failure enforcement — references `architecture/BUILD_ACTIVE` which does not exist in governance repo |
| `.github/workflows/merge-gate-interface.yml` | Legacy merge gate — references `.agent-admin/prehandover/` evidence bundle format no longer in use |
| `governance/executable/workflows/consumer-alignment.yml.template` | To be **replaced** (not just deleted) — see task 2 above |

**DO NOT delete:**
- `governance-layer-down-dispatch.yml` — keep, it is the correct sender
- `governance-layer-up-intake.yml` — keep, handles the bidirectional layer-up round-trip
- `governance-layer-up-close-loop.yml` — keep, completes the layer-up close loop
- `governance-gate.yml` — keep, structural integrity check
- `agent-contract-audit.yml` — keep, CS2 gate for agent file PRs

### 4. Update `.github/workflows/README.md`

Update the README to:
- Reflect the current active workflow inventory (post-deletions)
- Document the two-signal layer-down design (Signal 1: issue, Signal 2: repository_dispatch)
- List the decommissioned legacy workflows with rationale
- Reference `LAYERING_AND_RIPPLING_AUTOMATION_STRATEGY.md` as the authoritative design document

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `.github/layer-down-issue-template.md` contains full 5-phase surgical agent instructions
- [ ] `governance/executable/workflows/consumer-alignment.yml.template` produces `governance-layer-down-intake.yml` (agent-intake pattern, no auto-PR)
- [ ] All legacy workflows listed above are deleted
- [ ] `.github/workflows/README.md` is updated and accurate
- [ ] All active layer-down workflows (`governance-layer-down-dispatch.yml`, layer-up pair, governance gate, agent-contract-audit) are untouched
- [ ] PR passes governance gate and agent-contract-audit
- [ ] PREHANDOVER_PROOF attached

---

## Notes

- The **consumer-side** counterpart to this issue (replacing `governance-ripple-sync.yml` and `ripple-integration.yml` in `maturion-isms`) is tracked separately in `maturion-isms`
- After this issue is merged, the template will be layered down to all 4 consumer repos via the standard layer-down pipeline
- The 3 duplicate ripple PRs in `maturion-isms` (#639–641) are being resolved separately — do not block on them
