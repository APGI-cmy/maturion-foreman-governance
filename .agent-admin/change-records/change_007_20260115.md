   - Removed 4 embedded LOCKED sections (Contract Modification Prohibition, Pre-Gate Release Blocking, File Integrity Protection, Locked Sections Registry)
   - Added Protection Registry section documenting reference-based compliance
   - Maintained protection coverage through canonical protocol references

4. ✅ Added Protection Registry section:
   - Table mapping registry items to canonical authorities

   - Noted removal of embedded HTML LOCKED section markers by design

5. ✅ Added Self-Awareness & Continuous Improvement section:
   - Own contract review requirements
   - Cross-repository agent benchmarking
   - Self-assessment against governance
   - Performance limitation identification
   - Improvement proposal generation (Type A: contract, Type B: governance)
   - Bidirectional governance evolution framework

6. ✅ Added Workspace section:

### 2. governance-repo-administrator.agent.md v2.5.0 Upgrade (COMPLETE - Hybrid Model)

**File**: `.github/agents/governance-repo-administrator.agent.md`  
**Previous Version**: v2.6.0 (942 lines)  
**New Version**: v2.5.0 (1040 lines - hybrid model)  
**Change**: Maintained embedded LOCKED sections (hybrid model)

**Changes Made**:
1. ✅ Added `metadata` section to YAML front matter:
   - `version: 2.5.0`
   - `repository: APGI-cmy/maturion-foreman-governance`
   - `context: canonical-governance-source`
   - `protection_model: hybrid`
   - `references_locked_protocol: true`
   - `note: "Hybrid protection model (reference-based + embedded LOCKED) due to contract complexity..."`

2. ✅ Added governance bindings:
   - `AGENT_CONTRACT_PROTECTION_PROTOCOL.md` (contract-protection-requirements)
   - `LEARNING_INTAKE_AND_PROMOTION_MODEL.md` (learning-capture-and-promotion)

3. ✅ Added Protection Registry section (Hybrid Model):
   - Table documenting hybrid protection model (reference-based + embedded LOCKED)
   - Documented retention of embedded LOCKED sections for critical safeguards
   - Noted as target for future optimization to full reference-based protection

4. ✅ Added Self-Awareness & Continuous Improvement section:
   - Own contract review requirements
   - Cross-repository agent benchmarking (compare with consumer repos)
   - Self-assessment against governance
   - Performance limitation identification
   - Improvement proposal generation (Type A: contract, Type B: governance)
   - Bidirectional governance evolution framework

5. ✅ Added Workspace section:
   - `.agent-admin/` directory structure documentation
   - Subdirectories: scans/, risk-assessments/, change-records/, completion-reports/, self-assessments/

6. ✅ Updated version history:
   - Added v2.5.0 changelog with hybrid model documentation
   - Deprecated v2.6.0
   - Documented authority and governance sources

**Validation Results**:
- YAML syntax: ✅ VALID
- Line count: 1040 lines (hybrid model with embedded LOCKED sections - documented)
- Protection Registry presence: ✅ PRESENT (hybrid model)
- Metadata section: ✅ COMPLETE

**Hybrid Model Justification**:
Due to contract complexity and comprehensive responsibilities (QIW Channel awareness, IBWR protocol, agent contract migration coordination, incident handling, etc.), this contract maintains embedded LOCKED sections while adding v2.5.0 required elements. Documented as hybrid model in metadata and Protection Registry. Target for future optimization.
