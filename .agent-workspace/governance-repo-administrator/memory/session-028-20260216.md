### Actions Taken

1. **Wake-Up Protocol Execution**
   - Executed `.github/scripts/wake-up-protocol.sh governance-repo-administrator`
   - Loaded 5 previous session memories
   - Generated working contract with current governance context
   - Verified environment health: HEALTHY ✓
   - Reviewed CANON_INVENTORY.json (157 canons tracked)

2. **Multi-Repository Gap Analysis**
   - Delegated comprehensive analysis to general-purpose agent with GitHub MCP access
   - Analyzed 4 consumer repositories:
     - maturion-foreman-office-app (83/100 compliance)
     - PartPulse (47/100 compliance - CRITICAL)
     - R_Roster (97/100 compliance - GOLD STANDARD)
     - maturion-isms (87/100 compliance)
   - Identified 25 gaps across governance artifacts, agent contracts, merge gates, evidence protocols
   - Classified gaps by severity: 1 CRITICAL, 11 HIGH, 8 MEDIUM, 16 LOW
   - Documented findings with actionable recommendations per repository

3. **Ripple Alignment Strategy Development**
   - Designed 4-wave phased remediation approach:
     - Wave 1: Constitutional Compliance (PartPulse CANON_INVENTORY - 3 days)
     - Wave 2: Agent Contract Standardization (2 repos - 7 days)
     - Wave 3: Living Agent System v6.2.0 Upgrade (3 repos - 10 days)
     - Wave 4: Evidence & Documentation (4 repos - 5 days)
   - Total timeline: 21 days to full alignment
   - Resource allocation: 164 hours total effort
   - Risk assessment with mitigation strategies
   - Success criteria and validation requirements defined

4. **Critical Issue Template Creation**
   - Created PartPulse constitutional compliance ripple issue (P0 CRITICAL)
   - 3-day SLA for CANON_INVENTORY.json implementation
   - Detailed validation requirements and evidence templates
   - Clear acceptance criteria and workflow validation steps

5. **CS2 Escalation for Repository Status Decision**
   - Created escalation document for PartPulse repository status ambiguity
   - Conflicting signals: enabled in registry, but .DEPRECATED_NOTICE.md present
   - Provided decision options: ACTIVE / DEPRECATED / MAINTENANCE
   - Impact analysis and resource allocation per option
   - 2-day SLA for CS2 decision (blocking Wave 1 execution)

6. **Final Summary Report for CS2 Sign-Off**
   - Comprehensive 780-line report synthesizing all findings
   - Executive summary with key achievements and critical blockers
   - Repository-specific findings with compliance scores
   - Ripple strategy overview and resource requirements
   - Success metrics and risk summary
   - CS2 approval sections with sign-off checkboxes

### Decisions Made

1. **Use R_Roster as Reference Implementation**
   - Rationale: Highest compliance score (97/100), complete Living Agent System v6.2.0 alignment
   - Impact: Simplifies recommendations for other repositories
   - Evidence: CANON_INVENTORY.json with full SHA256 hashes, standard naming, optimal workflows

2. **Prioritize PartPulse Constitutional Compliance (P0)**
   - Rationale: Missing CANON_INVENTORY.json violates Tier-0 constitutional requirement (REQ-CM-001)
   - Impact: Blocks all subsequent PartPulse governance ripples
   - Evidence: Gap analysis compliance score 47/100 (CRITICAL)

3. **Escalate PartPulse Repository Status to CS2**
   - Rationale: Authority boundary - business/strategy decision beyond governance-repo-administrator scope
   - Impact: Blocks Wave 1 execution until resolved
   - Authority: REQ-AS-002 (CS2 escalation for constitutional semantics, authority boundaries)

4. **Adopt 4-Wave Phased Approach**
   - Rationale: Manageable scope per wave, clear dependencies prevent rework, resource allocation visible
   - Impact: 21-day timeline with blocking dependencies (Wave 1 → Wave 2 → Wave 3 → Wave 4)
   - Alternative considered: Parallel execution (rejected due to rework risk from naming changes)

5. **Target Compliance Scores ≥80/100 for All Repos**
   - Rationale: Eliminates CRITICAL and HIGH gaps, ensures constitutional compliance
   - Impact: Requires +33 points for PartPulse, +7 for maturion-foreman-office-app
   - Evidence: Gap reduction targets by wave defined in strategy

6. **Delegate Comprehensive Analysis to General-Purpose Agent**
   - Rationale: Efficient use of GitHub MCP tools for direct repository inspection
   - Impact: Comprehensive 955-line analysis completed in single task
   - Evidence: Consistent findings format across all 4 repositories

## Lessons

### What Worked Well

1. **Delegation to General-Purpose Agent**
   - Search_code_subagent for initial orientation worked well
   - Delegating full analysis to general-purpose agent with GitHub MCP access was highly efficient
   - Comprehensive 955-line analysis completed in single task
   - Consistent findings format across all repositories
   - Pattern: Delegate complex multi-step analysis to specialized agents

2. **Reference Implementation Approach**
   - Using R_Roster as gold standard simplified comparison
   - Enabled objective compliance scoring (97/100 vs 47/100 for PartPulse)
   - Clear best practices identified from reference repo
   - Pattern: Always identify reference implementation for cross-repo analysis

3. **Phased Wave Strategy**
   - 4-wave approach with clear dependencies prevents rework
   - Resource allocation visible upfront (164 hours total)
   - Blocking dependencies ensure logical sequencing (Wave 1 → 2 → 3 → 4)
   - Pattern: Phase complex ripples with dependency management

4. **Evidence-First Documentation**
   - All findings include file paths, examples, severity classification
   - Actionable recommendations per repository
   - Clear acceptance criteria for each wave
   - Pattern: Evidence-based governance enables objective decision-making

5. **Proactive CS2 Escalation**
   - Identified authority boundary early (PartPulse status decision)
   - Created structured escalation document with options, impact analysis
   - Prevents work on wrong path (if PartPulse is deprecated)
   - Pattern: Escalate early when strategic/business decisions required

### What Was Challenging

1. **Repository Status Ambiguity (PartPulse)**
   - Conflicting signals: enabled in registry vs .DEPRECATED_NOTICE.md present
   - Required CS2 escalation to resolve (2-day delay to Wave 1 execution)
   - Cannot proceed with constitutional compliance ripple until resolved
   - Challenge: Cross-repository status consistency tracking
   - Future: Canonical repository status field in CONSUMER_REPO_REGISTRY.json

2. **Cross-Repository Inconsistencies**
   - Agent contract naming varies: foreman-v2.agent.md vs foreman.md vs foreman-isms-agent.md
   - Dual CANON_INVENTORY locations (maturion-foreman-office-app)
   - Non-standard workspace structures
   - Challenge: No canonical naming standard enforced
   - Future: Create AGENT_CONTRACT_NAMING_STANDARD.md canon

3. **Workflow Proliferation**
   - maturion-foreman-office-app has 21 workflows (2x R_Roster's 9)
   - Difficult to assess which are legacy vs. required
   - Consolidation requires FM + CS2 review (risk of functionality loss)
   - Challenge: No workflow audit/consolidation protocol
   - Future: Workflow audit runbook with consolidation criteria

4. **Living Agent System v6.2.0 Adoption Gap**
   - Only R_Roster fully compliant with v6.2.0
   - Other repos have partial adoption or gaps
   - Wake-up/closure scripts missing in some repos
   - Challenge: Multi-wave upgrade coordination
   - Future: Scheduled v6.2.0 adoption enforcement with governance ripple

### What Future Sessions Should Know

1. **Always Check Repository Status Before Ripple**
   - Lesson: Don't assume registry status is accurate
   - Action: Verify production status, recent commits, active development
   - Evidence: PartPulse enabled in registry but has .DEPRECATED_NOTICE.md
   - Recommendation: Check README.md, commit history, open issues/PRs before creating ripple issues

2. **Use R_Roster as Living Agent System v6.2.0 Reference**
   - Lesson: R_Roster is the gold standard for v6.2.0 compliance (97/100)
   - Action: Copy patterns, scripts, structures from R_Roster to other repos
   - Evidence: Complete CANON_INVENTORY, standard naming, optimal workflows
   - Recommendation: Always reference R_Roster when upgrading other repos

3. **Delegate Complex Analysis to Sub-Agents**
   - Lesson: General-purpose agent with GitHub MCP access is highly effective for repo analysis
   - Action: Delegate multi-repo analysis rather than doing manually
   - Evidence: 955-line comprehensive analysis completed in single task
   - Recommendation: Use for future cross-repo gap analyses

4. **Escalate Early for Authority Boundaries**
   - Lesson: Strategic/business decisions require CS2 judgment
   - Action: Create structured escalation document with options and impact analysis
   - Evidence: PartPulse status decision escalated within Phase 1
   - Recommendation: Don't proceed with constitutional changes without CS2 approval

5. **Phase Ripples to Prevent Rework**
   - Lesson: Dependencies between ripples require sequencing (naming before v6.2.0)
   - Action: Design wave structure with blocking dependencies
   - Evidence: Wave 2 (naming) blocks Wave 3 (v6.2.0) to avoid rework on renamed files
   - Recommendation: Map dependencies before executing ripples

6. **Evidence-First Documentation Enables Objective Review**
   - Lesson: Detailed findings with file paths, examples, severity enable CS2 to make informed decisions
   - Action: Include specific examples, not just abstract gaps
   - Evidence: All 25 gaps have specific file paths, recommendations, requirements coverage
   - Recommendation: Always provide evidence trail for governance findings

### Governance Insights

1. **CANON_INVENTORY-First Governance is Working**
   - Constitutional requirement (REQ-CM-001) successfully identified critical violation (PartPulse)
   - Compliance score (47/100) objectively quantifies governance drift
   - Ripple mechanism provides clear remediation path
   - Insight: CANON_INVENTORY as constitutional requirement enables measurable governance

2. **Living Agent System v6.2.0 Adoption is Incomplete**
   - Only 1 of 4 repos (R_Roster) fully compliant with v6.2.0
   - Gap: Wake-up/closure scripts, working contract generation, memory rotation
   - Impact: Inconsistent agent operation across ecosystem
   - Insight: v6.2.0 adoption should be enforced via governance ripple

3. **Cross-Repository Consistency Requires Active Enforcement**
   - Drift occurs naturally without enforcement mechanisms
   - Examples: Naming variations, dual artifacts, workflow proliferation
   - Insight: Quarterly governance audits + automated compliance checks needed

4. **Governance Ripple Model Scales to Multi-Repo Ecosystems**
   - 4-wave approach with 21-day timeline is tractable
   - Resource allocation (164 hours) is reasonable for 4 repos
   - Phased dependencies prevent rework
   - Insight: Governance ripple model is production-ready for ecosystem-scale alignment

5. **Reference Implementation Pattern Accelerates Compliance**
   - R_Roster (97/100) provides proven patterns for other repos
   - Reduces guesswork and debate about best practices
   - Enables objective comparison and gap identification
   - Insight: Always maintain at least one reference implementation for each canonical protocol
