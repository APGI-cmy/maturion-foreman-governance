## Feature Enhancement Proposals

After reviewing the v2.5.0 upgrade work, the following enhancement proposals are identified:

### Enhancement Proposal 1: Automated Contract Optimization Tool

**Status**: ⏸️ PARKED — NOT AUTHORIZED FOR EXECUTION

**Description**:
Create a tool to automatically optimize agent contracts to reference-based protection model. This tool would:
- Identify embedded LOCKED sections
- Map protections to canonical protocol references
- Generate Protection Registry tables
- Validate protection coverage completeness
- Reduce contract line counts while maintaining protection

**Benefit**:
- Accelerates future contract upgrades to reference-based model
- Reduces manual effort in converting embedded protections
- Ensures consistent Protection Registry format across all contracts
- Helps maintain < 400 line target for all contracts

**Routing**: `governance/parking-station/governance-improvements/`

**Authority**: Proposed under MANDATORY_ENHANCEMENT_CAPTURE_STANDARD.md v2.0.0

### Enhancement Proposal 2: Contract Complexity Metrics Dashboard

**Status**: ⏸️ PARKED — NOT AUTHORIZED FOR EXECUTION

**Description**:
Create a dashboard to track agent contract metrics across all repositories:
- Line count trends over time
- Protection model distribution (reference-based vs hybrid vs embedded)
- v2.5.0 compliance status
- Governance binding coverage
- Cross-repo benchmarking results

**Benefit**:
- Visibility into contract optimization progress
- Identifies contracts needing upgrade/optimization
- Enables data-driven governance improvement decisions
- Supports cross-repo standardization efforts

**Routing**: `governance/parking-station/governance-improvements/`

**Authority**: Proposed under MANDATORY_ENHANCEMENT_CAPTURE_STANDARD.md v2.0.0
