# Session 003 - 20260301 — IAA Assurance Session (Living Agent System v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: independent-assurance-agent
- Class: assurance
- Session ID: IAA-20260301-PR1255
- Canon version loaded: INDEPENDENT_ASSURANCE_AGENT_CANON.md v1.0.0 (SHA256 verified: YES — canonical governance repo)

## Preflight

### FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Attestation
- Self-attested against all Universal Rules (A-001 through A-019): YES — all rules read in full, self-attested as CLEAR
- Self-attested against legacy B-series conditional rules: N/A — B-series deprecated per v1.3.0; mapped to A-series (B-01/B-02/B-03/B-04/B-09/B-12 → A-015; B-05 → A-005)
- Violations found: NONE (IAA-side); GA-side A-09 breach acknowledged in PR context — this is the GA's rule violation, not IAA's
- A-004 (Bootstrap Directive): ATTESTED — .github/agents/independent-assurance-agent.md was the FIRST file read in this session

### Independence Check
- IAA identity: independent-assurance-agent, assurance class, session IAA-20260301-PR1255
- Submitting agent identity: governance-repo-administrator (Copilot), administrator class
- Independence confirmed: YES — distinct agent classes; no overlap in PR authorship

### Knowledge Load
- Tier 1: INDEPENDENT_ASSURANCE_AGENT_CANON.md v1.0.0 — hash verified: YES (CANON_INVENTORY check passed)
- Tier 1: LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md v1.1.0 — loaded: YES
- Tier 2 checklist: iaa-core-invariants-checklist.md v1.2.0 — loaded: YES
- Tier 2 overlays: iaa-category-overlays.md v1.2.0 — loaded: YES
- Tier 2 FAIL-ONLY-ONCE: FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md v1.3.0 — loaded: YES (read in full)
- Tier 3 (PR context): PR #1255 — fix: eliminate silent failures and add regression guard for governance layer-down dispatch
- Overlays applicable: D (governance-gate.yml workflow), E (RCA + backfill docs), F (session close)

## Phase Review Findings

### Phase 1 — Preflight Proof

- Artifact present: NO
- Agent identity cited with version: N/A (no artifact)
- FAIL-ONLY-ONCE attestation confirmed: N/A (no artifact)
- OPOJD acknowledged: N/A (no artifact)
- Knowledge load cited: N/A (no artifact)
- Constraints section present: N/A (no artifact)
- **Finding**: FAIL — Preflight proof absent; all INV-101 through INV-106 fail. PR was committed before governance evidence was created — acknowledged A-09 breach.

### Phase 2 — Governance Proof
- Artifact location: ABSENT — .agent-admin/evidence/governance-proof-1255.md does not exist
- Artifact present: NO
- Canon citations include versions: N/A (no artifact)
- Hash validation performed: N/A (no artifact)
- Protected file CS2 approval cited: N/A — no protected files changed
- Gate requirements cited: N/A (no artifact)
- CANON_INVENTORY placeholder hashes: Independently verified — NONE (CANON_INVENTORY not touched by this PR)
- Ripple assessment: N/A (no artifact; workflow changes, not canon changes)
- **Finding**: FAIL — Governance proof absent; all INV-201 through INV-207 (except INV-204: N/A) fail.

### Phase 3 — Working Proof
- Artifact location: ABSENT — .agent-admin/evidence/working-proof-1255.md does not exist
- Artifact present: NO
- Note: docs/governance/layer-down-rca-2026-02.md is a substantive delivery artifact (RCA report) not a working proof evidence bundle item
- Delivery-specific rationale: N/A (no working proof artifact)
- Design decisions documented: N/A (no artifact)
- Alternatives considered: N/A (no artifact)
- Issue/wave reference: "Fixes #1254" in PR body — present in PR but not in a working proof artifact
- Risk section: N/A (no artifact)
- **Finding**: FAIL — Working proof absent; all INV-301 through INV-307 fail.

### Phase 4 — Handover Proof
- Artifact location: ABSENT — .agent-admin/prehandover/prehandover_proof_1255*.md does not exist
- Artifact present: NO
- GREEN state claim: N/A (no artifact)
- Gate parity check (INV-405 BLOCKING): NOT PERFORMED — no evidence of gate parity check
- PR draft status (INV-409): FAIL — PR #1255 confirmed in DRAFT state via GitHub API
- **Finding**: FAIL — Handover proof absent; INV-401 through INV-409 all fail; INV-405 BLOCKING triggered; INV-409 independent FAIL (draft PR).

### Agent Integrity
- Agent files in PR diff: NONE (confirmed via git diff)
- INV-501 to INV-503: N/A — no agent files changed
- INV-504: PASS — integrity check performed
  - **⚠️ PRE-EXISTING DRIFT DETECTED**: All three INTEGRITY_INDEX-indexed agent files have SHA256 hashes diverging from their 2026-02-24 baselines. Drift predates PR #1255 and is not caused by it.
  - ESC-002 escalation filed: .agent-workspace/independent-assurance-agent/escalation-inbox/esc-002-integrity-drift-20260301.md

## Content Quality Assessment

Technical work in PR #1255 is sound and substantive:
- Dispatch failure tracking (replacing `|| echo` with `|| { echo ...; echo ... >> failure-file; }`) correctly addresses Root Cause 2
- Artifact upload with `if-no-files-found: ignore` is correct
- YAML lint job prevents Root Cause 4 recurrence
- RCA document is comprehensive (4 root causes, real run numbers, complete AC table)
- Backfill guide is operational and specific

The REJECTION-PACKAGE reflects a **process failure only, not a quality failure**.

## Binary Verdict

```
REJECTION-PACKAGE
PR: #1255
Date: 2026-03-01
IAA Session: IAA-20260301-PR1255
Verdict: MERGE BLOCKED
```

**Rationale**: All four phase evidence artifacts (preflight, governance, working, handover) are absent. PR is in DRAFT state. INV-405 (BLOCKING) triggered. Technical work is sound; process remediation is the sole requirement.

## Recurring Shortfalls Detected

| Shortfall | First Seen | Times Seen | Action Taken |
|-----------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| GA commits work and calls report_progress before invoking IAA (A-09 breach) | session-002 / PR #1253 | **2nd occurrence** (this session, PR #1255) | Flagging for FAIL-ONLY-ONCE promotion (INV-603). First occurrence already added A-09 to GA registry — it did not prevent recurrence. |
| PR submitted for assurance while in DRAFT state | session-002 context (bootstrapped as systemic) | Observed | INV-409 applied — draft state blocked |

---

## 🔄 LEARNING LOOP (MANDATORY — INV-601 to INV-605)

### Improvement Suggestions for This Session

1. **A-09 breach is recurring — promote to IAA FAIL-ONLY-ONCE as a detection rule**: The GA's FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-09 codified the requirement but did not prevent the second breach. The IAA should have a corresponding detection rule (in its own FAIL-ONLY-ONCE registry) that explicitly checks for A-09-pattern breaches when the invocation package explicitly states the PR was committed before IAA was invoked. Current rule A-015 covers the general case; a targeted GA-behavior detection rule would add specificity.

2. **The evidence artifact directory structure should be scaffolded at session start**: When a GA session begins for a triggered PR, it should immediately create stub evidence files (even empty) in `.agent-admin/evidence/` so that forgetting to populate them before `report_progress` is harder. This could be codified as a GA Phase 0 action or a pre-`report_progress` checklist gate.

3. **INTEGRITY_INDEX.md maintenance process needs a hard gate**: All three indexed agent files have drifted from their INTEGRITY_INDEX baselines. There is no merge gate check that verifies agent file changes are accompanied by INTEGRITY_INDEX updates. A merge gate check for INTEGRITY_INDEX synchronization would prevent this from recurring. Recommend escalating to CS2 for a gate requirement addition.

4. **Session-002 improvement suggestion still not actioned**: "IAA invocation must be integrated into the GA Phase 4 handover script" was identified in session-002 and deferred. The fact that a second A-09 breach occurred in the very next GA-submitted PR confirms this suggestion is high-priority. Escalating to CS2 for prioritization.

### Recurring Shortfalls to Promote

- **A-09 pattern (GA commits before invoking IAA) — 2nd occurrence**: Per INV-603, this recurring shortfall must be flagged for FAIL-ONLY-ONCE promotion. Specifically: the IAA FAIL-ONLY-ONCE registry should gain a rule that, when an invocation explicitly acknowledges a pre-commit A-09 breach, IAA must immediately issue REJECTION-PACKAGE without proceeding to evidence review — forcing the evidence to be created first, not assessed after the fact.

### Prior Session Improvements Review

| Session | Improvement Suggestion | Status This Session |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------|
| session-001 | "IAA agent contract file verification needed" | DEFERRED — not in scope |
| session-002 | "IAA invocation must be integrated into GA Phase 4 handover script" | NOT ACTIONED — second A-09 breach occurred in the very next GA-submitted PR (#1255). Escalating to CS2 for prioritization. |

### Tier-2 Updates Triggered by This Session

- [ ] FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md update: Add rule A-020 (Pre-Commit IAA Invocation Pattern Detection) — flagged for next session / CS2-authorized PR
