# Session 001 - 20260224 (Living Agent System v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: governance-repo-administrator / foreman-v2 (POLC-Orchestration mode)
- Class: administrator
- Session ID: fail-only-once-registry-seed

## Task
Create and activate a permanent "Fail Only Once" registry for Foreman v2 (Issue: [FAIL-ONLY-ONCE] Compile Tier 2 registry from all session memory, RCAs, and breach history — then layer down and activate preflight enforcement).

## What I Did
### Files Modified / Created
- `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/knowledge/FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md` — Created FAIL-ONLY-ONCE registry (v1.0.0, seeded 2026-02-24) with 17 Universal Rules (A-01..A-17), 11 Conditional Rules (B-01..B-11), full Breach Log (Section C)
- `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/knowledge/index.md` — Created Tier 2 knowledge index referencing FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md
- `governance/canon/FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md` — Layer-down copy for cross-repo canonical consumption
- `.github/agents/foreman-v2.agent.md` — Bumped contract to v2.3.0, added FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Attestation preflight step
- `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/session-001-20260224.md` — This session memory

### Actions Taken
- Action 1: Compiled breaches from governance/incidents/, governance/RCA_SCOPE_VIOLATION_20260217.md, escalation-inbox foreman files, and issue description (GOV-BREACH-AIMC-W2-001, PR #462 regression, PR #479, PR #483)
- Action 2: Created FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md with all minimum required rules (A-01..A-10, B-01..B-06) plus 7 additional rules derived from memory compilation (A-11..A-17, B-07..B-11)
- Action 3: Created knowledge/index.md registering FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md as Tier 2
- Action 4: Layered down to governance/canon/FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md
- Action 5: Updated foreman-v2 contract to v2.3.0 with FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Attestation preflight step (via CodexAdvisor-agent appointment)

### Decisions Made
- Decision 1: Added 7 additional rules beyond the minimum 16 required, sourced from actual incidents in the repo (false attestation, test warning suppression, stale scope declarations, catastrophic handover failures, stub QA acceptance, governance ambiguity self-interpretation)
- Decision 2: Created fresh foreman-v2 workspace since it did not exist yet; this is the seed session

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: Rules in FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md Section C all cite actual incident files present in the repo
- Status: Complete — all minimum rules present plus additional rules from memory compilation

### Ripple Status
- Status: Layer-down executed to governance/canon/FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md
- Ripple required: YES — done

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: FAIL-ONLY-ONCE preflight attestation added to foreman-v2 contract v2.3.0

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: No phantom entries; FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md added to knowledge/index.md

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

## RCA — Failing Handover (A-15 breach)

### Breach
PR #1195 was handed over to CS2 as ready-to-merge while the **POLICY-NO-ONLY-LANGUAGE** CI gate was failing.

### Root Cause
The PR title "Add FAIL-ONLY-ONCE breach prevention registry and activate Foreman v2 preflight enforcement" contains the word `ONLY` as a standalone word (because `-` is a regex word boundary, so `FAIL-ONLY-ONCE` causes `\bonly\b` to match).

### Scanner Scope Investigation
- The `merge-gate-interface.yml` workflow at step "Validate no-minimizing language" scans **PR title only** using: `PR_TITLE="${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}"`
- Patterns checked: `\bonly\b`, `\bjust\b`, `\bsimply\b`, `\bmerely\b`, `\btrivial\b`, `\bminimal\b`, `\bsmall\b`
- File contents, PR body, and commit messages are **NOT** scanned by this check
- The compound term in the PR title (`FAIL-ONLY-ONCE`) was the trigger; `-` acts as a word boundary making `ONLY` a standalone word match

### Corrective Actions
1. Appended rule A-18 to FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md (Section A) with breach log entry in Section C
2. Synced governance/canon/FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md layer-down copy
3. PR title must be changed by CS2 to: "Add breach-prevention registry and activate Foreman v2 preflight enforcement" (contains no banned words)
4. PR body updated to remove bare `FAIL-ONLY-ONCE` references where they would be policy-scanning concerns

### New Rule Added
- **A-18** (Evidence): I do NOT promote a PR from DRAFT or present it to CS2 without first verifying all merge gate CI checks pass, including policy checks, not just test and code review gates.

## Lessons
### What Worked Well
- Breach compilation from incident files gave clear, concrete rule sourcing
- Section C breach log entries all have verifiable incident references

### What Was Challenging
- foreman-v2 workspace did not exist; required bootstrapping from scratch
- Session memory files referenced in the issue (session-001 through session-052) do not exist in this repo; compiled from available incident/RCA files instead

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- This file is the seed — rule count starts at A-01..A-17, B-01..B-11
- Every RCA going forward MUST append a new rule to FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md and a new breach log entry to Section C
- governance/canon/FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md is the layer-down authoritative copy

### Governance Insights
- Breach patterns show clustering: evidence fabrication (A-04,A-05,A-06,A-11), process sequencing (A-01,A-02,B-01,B-02), and self-implementation (A-03,B-03) are the three primary failure families
