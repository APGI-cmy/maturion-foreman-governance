### Actions Taken
- Action 1: Read `AGENT_HANDOVER_AUTOMATION.md` v1.1.1 to understand §4.3 canonical template
- Action 2: Self-attested against FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md (all rules checked — no violations)
- Action 3: Inspected all three agent contracts in `.github/agents/` — confirmed none had §4.3 Pre-Handover Merge Gate Parity Check
- Action 4: Patched `foreman-v2.agent.md`: inserted §4.3 (FM_H), renumbered old §4.3 → §4.4 "Builder QA & Compliance Check"
- Action 5: Patched `CodexAdvisor-agent.md`: inserted §4.3 (CA_H), renumbered old §4.3 → §4.4 "Compliance Check"
- Action 6: Patched `governance-repo-administrator-v2.agent.md`: inserted §4.3 (GA_H), renumbered old §4.3 → §4.4 "Compliance Check"
- Action 7: Added ripple tracking fields to CANON_INVENTORY.json entry for AGENT_HANDOVER_AUTOMATION.md
- Action 8: Added CHANGELOG entry `[AGENT-HANDOVER-PARITY-RIPPLE]` (newest-first)
- Action 9: Created ripple log at `.agent-admin/governance/ripple-logs/ripple-agent-handover-parity-20260224.md`
- Action 10: Performed memory rotation (archived session-050-20260223.md)

### Decisions Made
- Decision 1: Each §4.3 uses the canonical template from §4.3 of `AGENT_HANDOVER_AUTOMATION.md` adapted with agent-specific priority codes (FM_H, CA_H, GA_H) — no semantic deviation from canon
- Decision 2: The merge-gate/verdict check in the foreman contract checks `FAILED_TESTS` variable (consistent with existing FM compliance check pattern); CodexAdvisor checks gate-results JSON; GA checks prehandover proof count
- Decision 3: CANON_INVENTORY.json ripple fields added inline to the AGENT_HANDOVER_AUTOMATION entry — does not change the hash or any validated field, only adds tracking metadata
- Decision 4: Consumer repo ripple documented in ripple log with a ready-to-use issue template — actual GitHub issues to be created by CS2 or by consumer repo governance liaisons via the standard layer-down process
- Decision 5: This change is operational (syntactic ripple propagation within GA authority) — not a semantic canon change — CS2 approval already covers it via PR #1202

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: this session memory + ripple log
- Status: COMPLETE

### Ripple Status
- Ripple required: YES — `AGENT_HANDOVER_AUTOMATION.md` v1.1.1 is PUBLIC_API tier
- In-repo ripple: ✅ COMPLETE (all three agent contracts patched)
- Consumer repo ripple: ⏳ PENDING — issues to be created in 4 consumer repos
- Ripple log: `.agent-admin/governance/ripple-logs/ripple-agent-handover-parity-20260224.md`

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: Closed gap where agent contracts had only 3 Phase 4 sections instead of the canonical 4 sections

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: CANON_INVENTORY.json valid JSON ✅; CHANGELOG entry follows format ✅; ripple log follows existing pattern ✅

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE (in-repo) | ⏳ PENDING (consumer repo layer-down issues)

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Canon v1.1.1 §4.3 provided a clear template with the three-gate pattern; adaptation to each agent required only priority-code substitution and minor agent-specific verdict check logic
- Reading session-053 and session-054 first eliminated all ambiguity about what had already been done to the canon vs. what still needed rippling
- All three agent contracts had identical structural gaps (missing §4.3), so a single consistent pattern worked for all three patches

### What Was Challenging
- CANON_INVENTORY.json does not have a dedicated `ripple_status` field in the schema — added tracking fields inline; CS2 may wish to formalize these fields in the schema at a future session
- Consumer repos cannot be cloned directly; ripple documented with issue template for manual creation

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- The consumer repo ripple (layer-down issues for 4 repos) is still PENDING — pick this up in the next session or have CS2 create the issues
- The ripple log template at `.agent-admin/governance/ripple-logs/ripple-agent-handover-parity-20260224.md` contains a ready-to-use GitHub issue body for all 4 consumer repos
- When patching agent contracts across repos, always use the same three-gate pattern: merge-gate/verdict, governance/alignment, stop-and-fix/enforcement — with agent-specific priority codes

### Governance Insights
- The §4.3 parity check closes a real gap: previously agents could open PRs on known local failures. Making this BLOCKING and explicitly equated to "pushing to main" is the right level of enforcement
- CANON_INVENTORY.json could benefit from a formal `ripple` object in the schema to track dispatch, completion, and consumer status per canon entry — currently handled informally via inline fields
