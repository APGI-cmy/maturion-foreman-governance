# Session 024 - 20260214 (Living Agent System v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: governance-repo-administrator
- Class: administrator
- Session ID: session-024-20260214

## Task
Survey, rationalize, and update canon inventory files and structure — eliminate duplicates, waste, and conflicts (Issue: Governance Structure Survey Request).

## What I Did
### Files Modified
- `governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json` — Fixed stale hashes, added missing entry, updated counts
- `GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md` — Updated summary, added comprehensive survey findings section

### Actions Taken
- Action 1: Surveyed all 1018+ markdown files across the entire repository
- Action 2: Validated all 156 CANON_INVENTORY.json entries against files on disk (sha256 verification)
- Action 3: Fixed stale SHA256 hash for LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md
- Action 4: Fixed stale short hash for AGENT_ENVIRONMENTAL_RESPONSIBILITY_DOCTRINE.md
- Action 5: Added missing .agent.schema.md entry to canon inventory
- Action 6: Identified 20 duplicate filenames across the repository
- Action 7: Documented 69 canon entries with incomplete provenance data
- Action 8: Documented 67 root-level markdown files contributing to clutter
- Action 9: Produced 5 structural recommendations (all require CS2 approval)

### Decisions Made
- Decision 1: Files outside governance/canon/ (11 policy/strategy/template files) are correctly placed — no move needed
- Decision 2: Root-level file archival and structural changes require CS2 approval — documented as recommendations only
- Decision 3: Provenance gaps documented but not auto-filled — requires manual review of canon headers

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: Inline in GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md Survey Findings section
- Status: Complete

### Ripple Status
- Status: No ripple required — inventory corrections are internal bookkeeping
- Ripple required: NO

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: Identified provenance gaps (69 entries), duplicate files, root-level clutter
- Documented in Survey Findings section with CS2 recommendations

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: CANON_INVENTORY.json now fully validated (0 hash mismatches, 0 missing files)

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

## Lessons
### What Worked Well
- Automated Python script for full sha256 verification caught all issues reliably
- Systematic approach: disk → inventory → cross-reference identified all gaps

### What Was Challenging
- Large repository (1018+ md files) requires automated tooling for any comprehensive survey
- Provenance data (effective_date, version) cannot be automatically extracted from all canon headers

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- CANON_INVENTORY.json now has 156 entries, all with verified sha256 hashes
- 69 entries still have unknown effective_date — future session should address this
- 5 structural recommendations pending CS2 approval (see Survey Findings in GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md)

### Governance Insights
- The governance/canon/ directory contains 145 files; inventory tracks 156 (11 are in policy/strategy/templates)
- Root-level accumulation of historical files is the biggest structural issue
