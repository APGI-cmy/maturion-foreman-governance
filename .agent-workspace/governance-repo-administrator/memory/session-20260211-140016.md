## Agent
- Type: governance-repo-administrator
- Session ID: 20260211-140016
- Branch: copilot/regenerate-canon-inventory-json

## Context
- Issue: N/A
- Purpose: Regenerate CANON_INVENTORY.json and normalize line endings for deterministic PUBLIC_API checks

## Actions Taken

- Audited 102 PUBLIC_API artifacts for line endings, found 1 CRLF file
- Normalized QA_POLICY_MASTER.md from CRLF to LF
- Created .gitattributes to enforce LF line endings
- Created scripts/regenerate_canon_inventory.py
- Regenerated CANON_INVENTORY.json with 151 canons
- Created evidence bundle and session memory

## Decisions Made

- Preserve layer_down_status from existing inventory to prevent classification drift
- Use .gitattributes to enforce LF for all future commits
- Create reusable regeneration script for future maintenance

## Lessons Learned

- First script version did not preserve layer_down_status causing 102 to 19 PUBLIC_API drop
- Python newline parameter is clean and reliable for line ending normalization
- Evidence-first approach caught critical bugs before commit

## Patterns Observed

- Line endings matter for governance - platform differences break hash validation
- Automation enables accuracy - manual JSON editing is error-prone

## Next Session Recommendations

- Dispatch layer-down ripple to consumer repos for QA_POLICY_MASTER.md hash change
- Use scripts/regenerate_canon_inventory.py for future inventory updates
- Monitor for new files not in inventory during future scans

## Handover State
- Status: COMPLETE
- Environment: CLEAN
