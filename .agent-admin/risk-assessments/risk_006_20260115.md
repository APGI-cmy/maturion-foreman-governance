# Risk Assessment: Agent Contract v2.5.0 Upgrade
**Risk ID**: 006  
**Date**: 2026-01-15 13:08:55 UTC  
**Agent**: agent-contract-administrator  
**Job**: Upgrade All Agent Contracts to Canonical v2.5.0  
**Repository**: APGI-cmy/maturion-foreman-governance

## Executive Summary

This risk assessment evaluates the upgrade of all agent contracts in the canonical governance repository to v2.5.0 model. The upgrade involves adding protection registry sections, self-awareness frameworks, and converting CodexAdvisor from embedded to reference-based protection model.

**Overall Risk Level**: MEDIUM  
**Mitigation Status**: MANAGEABLE with careful execution

## Risk Categories

### 1. Contract Modification Risks

#### Risk 1.1: Self-Modification Conflict
**Category**: Governance Integrity  
**Likelihood**: LOW  
**Impact**: CATASTROPHIC  
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM

**Description**: I (agent-contract-administrator) am modifying my own contract as part of this upgrade.

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Work is authorized by CS2-approved issue
- ✅ Changes are additive (no removal/weakening)
- ✅ Following canonical v2.5.0 model exactly
- ✅ No deviation from prescribed pattern
- ✅ Will validate changes against canonical model
- ⚠️ ESCALATE: Any deviation from prescribed pattern

**Residual Risk**: LOW (with strict adherence to canonical model)

#### Risk 1.2: Locked Section Modification (CodexAdvisor)
**Category**: Protection Model  
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: HIGH  
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH

**Description**: CodexAdvisor has 4 embedded LOCKED sections that must be converted to reference-based protection. This involves removing HTML comment markers while maintaining protection coverage.

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Conversion follows canonical v2.5.0 pattern (reference-based)
- ✅ Protection coverage maintained via Protection Registry
- ✅ No weakening of protections (transformation only)
- ✅ Document conversion rationale in version history
- ✅ Validate locked section script doesn't break
- ⚠️ Test CI gate behavior after conversion

**Residual Risk**: LOW (conversion is prescribed by canonical model)

### 2. Technical Risks

#### Risk 2.1: YAML Syntax Errors
**Category**: Validation  
**Likelihood**: LOW  
**Impact**: MEDIUM  
**Risk Level**: LOW

**Description**: Adding metadata sections to YAML front matter could introduce syntax errors.

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Validate YAML with yamllint before handover
- ✅ Follow exact pattern from agent-contract-administrator.md
- ✅ Test YAML parsing locally
- ✅ CI gate will catch any errors

**Residual Risk**: VERY LOW

#### Risk 2.2: Line Count Violations
**Category**: Compliance  
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM (CodexAdvisor)  
**Impact**: MEDIUM  
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM

**Description**: CodexAdvisor is currently 856 lines (over 400 limit). Upgrade adds content while removing locked sections.

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Convert embedded locked sections to references (major reduction)
- ✅ Consolidate duplicate sections
- ✅ Remove redundant content
- ✅ Target: < 400 lines per issue requirement
- ⚠️ Monitor line count during editing
- ⚠️ ESCALATE if cannot achieve < 400 lines

**Residual Risk**: LOW (embedded sections are verbose; conversion will reduce significantly)

#### Risk 2.3: Schema Compliance
**Category**: Validation  
**Likelihood**: LOW  
**Impact**: MEDIUM  
**Risk Level**: LOW

**Description**: Changes must comply with `.agent.schema.md`

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Follow canonical v2.5.0 model (already schema-compliant)
- ✅ Metadata section follows schema pattern
- ✅ CI gate validates schema compliance

**Residual Risk**: VERY LOW

### 3. Governance Risks

#### Risk 3.1: Incomplete Protection Coverage
**Category**: Governance Integrity  
**Likelihood**: LOW  
**Impact**: HIGH  
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM

**Description**: Reference-based protection must maintain same coverage as embedded locked sections.

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Protection Registry explicitly maps all protections
- ✅ Canonical protocols provide comprehensive coverage
- ✅ No protection gaps in v2.5.0 model
- ✅ Authority references clear and traceable
- ✅ Document all protection mappings in registry

**Residual Risk**: VERY LOW (canonical model proven)

#### Risk 3.2: Governance Binding Gaps
**Category**: Governance Compliance  
**Likelihood**: LOW  
**Impact**: MEDIUM  
**Risk Level**: LOW

**Description**: New sections reference governance protocols that should be in bindings.

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Review all governance references
- ✅ Add missing bindings to YAML front matter
- ✅ Validate binding paths exist
- ✅ Cross-reference with canonical model

**Residual Risk**: VERY LOW

#### Risk 3.3: Cross-Repository Ripple Impact
**Category**: Ecosystem  
**Likelihood**: HIGH  
**Impact**: MEDIUM  
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM

**Description**: This is canonical governance source. Changes ripple to all consumer repos.

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Document ripple expectations in completion summary
- ✅ This upgrade establishes v2.5.0 canonical model
- ✅ Consumer repos will follow this pattern
- ✅ Notify governance administrator after completion
- ℹ️ Ripple coordination not in my scope (governance-repo-administrator responsibility)

**Residual Risk**: LOW (ripple is expected and managed)

### 4. Operational Risks

#### Risk 4.1: CI Gate Failures
**Category**: Validation  
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: MEDIUM  
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM

**Description**: Changes may trigger CI gate failures requiring remediation.

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Run local validation before handover (MANDATORY per Section 4.2)
- ✅ Validate YAML syntax (yamllint)
- ✅ Check line counts
- ✅ Verify protection registry format
- ✅ Test locked section script
- ✅ Document all validation results
- ⚠️ HALT on any validation failure
- ⚠️ Remediate before handover

**Residual Risk**: LOW (with pre-gate validation)

#### Risk 4.2: Breaking Changes to Consumer Repos
**Category**: Compatibility  
**Likelihood**: LOW  
**Impact**: MEDIUM  
**Risk Level**: LOW

**Description**: v2.5.0 model changes could break existing consumer repo contracts.

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ v2.5.0 is additive upgrade (no breaking changes)
- ✅ Reference-based protection is compatible pattern
- ✅ Consumer repos can upgrade incrementally
- ℹ️ Breaking changes not expected

**Residual Risk**: VERY LOW

### 5. Handover Risks

#### Risk 5.1: Incomplete Governance Artifacts
**Category**: Handover Compliance  
**Likelihood**: LOW  
**Impact**: HIGH  
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM

**Description**: PREHANDOVER_PROOF requires all 4 governance artifacts.

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Governance scan created (scan_20260115_130855.md)
- ✅ Risk assessment created (this document)
- 🔲 Change record (will create during work)
- 🔲 Completion summary (will create after work)
- ✅ Follow PREHANDOVER_PROOF template v2.0.0

**Residual Risk**: VERY LOW (artifacts in progress)

#### Risk 5.2: Missing Enhancement Capture
**Category**: Continuous Improvement  
**Likelihood**: LOW  
**Impact**: MEDIUM  
**Risk Level**: LOW

**Description**: Mandatory enhancement capture required after job.

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Aware of requirement (v2.0.0 standard)
- ✅ Will complete both:
  - Feature Enhancement Review
  - Process Improvement Reflection (5 questions)
- ✅ Will mark proposals "PARKED - NOT AUTHORIZED FOR EXECUTION"

**Residual Risk**: VERY LOW

**Overall Risk Level**: MEDIUM  
**Manageable**: YES  
**Blockers Identified**: NONE  
**Escalation Required**: NO (proceed with caution)

## Execution Recommendations

1. **Proceed with upgrade** following canonical v2.5.0 model exactly
2. **Start with governance-repo-administrator** (simpler, less risky)

4. **Validate continuously** (YAML, line counts, protection coverage)
5. **Pre-gate validation MANDATORY** before handover
6. **Document all changes** in change record
7. **Complete all governance artifacts** per PREHANDOVER_PROOF v2.0.0

**HALT and ESCALATE if**:
- Cannot achieve < 400 lines for any contract
- YAML syntax errors cannot be resolved
- Protection coverage gaps identified
- CI gate validation failures cannot be remediated
- Any requirement removal/weakening becomes necessary
- Self-modification feels conflicted or uncertain

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM (MANAGEABLE)  
**Blockers**: NONE  
**Authorization**: PROCEED with execution per canonical v2.5.0 model
