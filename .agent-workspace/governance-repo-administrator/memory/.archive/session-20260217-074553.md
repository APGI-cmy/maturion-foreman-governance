## Agent
- Type: governance-repo-administrator
- Session ID: 20260217-074553
- Branch: copilot/create-escalation-policy-md

## Context
- Issue: Create Canonical ESCALATION_POLICY.md
- Purpose: Consolidate all distributed escalation protocols into canonical governance/canon/ESCALATION_POLICY.md with model-specific cognitive escalation guidance

## Actions Taken

- Created governance/canon/ESCALATION_POLICY.md v3.0.0 (32KB comprehensive canonical file)
- Updated 30+ file references from governance/escalation/ to governance/canon/
- Deprecated old governance/escalation/ESCALATION_POLICY.md with notice
- Added to CANON_INVENTORY.json with SHA256 hash (164 canons)
- Updated governance/CHANGELOG.md with comprehensive entry
- Validated all cross-references and security
- Created session memory and learning artifacts

## Decisions Made

- Consolidate all escalation content into single canonical file - eliminates ambiguity and fixes broken references
- Include model-specific Sonnet→Opus/o1 guidance - critical for agent ecosystem complexity awareness
- Deprecate old file with notice rather than delete - preserves historical reference and audit trail
- Mark as PUBLIC_API for layer-down - all governed repositories need escalation protocols

## Lessons Learned

- Search-first strategy with search_code_subagent finds distributed content faster and more comprehensively than manual exploration
- Batch sed updates for similar files reduces errors and saves time vs manual edits
- Comprehensive canonical files better than minimal summaries for constitutional governance topics
- Deprecation with clear notice safer than deletion for constitutional content

## Patterns Observed

- Canonical file consolidation: search→create→update→deprecate→inventory→changelog→validate
- Model escalation guidance: distinguish authority escalation from capability switching, integrate with capability orchestration

## Next Session Recommendations

- ESCALATION_POLICY.md is now canonical source at governance/canon/ESCALATION_POLICY.md
- Layer-down ripple required to propagate PUBLIC_API canonical file to all consumer repositories
- All escalation references should use governance/canon/ESCALATION_POLICY.md path
