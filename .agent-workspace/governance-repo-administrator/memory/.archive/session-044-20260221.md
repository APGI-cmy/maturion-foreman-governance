## Task
**Issue**: [Governance Canon] Clarify and Fix Layering Down, Layering Up, and Rippling Terminology & Implementation

**Objective**: Audit and fix inconsistent usage of "layering down", "layering up", and "rippling" terminology across governance canons, scripts, and workflows. Create precise canonical definitions and automation strategy document.

## What I Did

### Files Modified

1. **governance/canon/ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY.md** (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0)
   - Added three new canonical term definitions:
     - **layering down**: Cross-repo distribution of governance artifacts (Governance → Consumer repos)
     - **layering up**: Cross-repo propagation of learnings (Consumer repos → Governance)
     - **rippling**: Within-repo integration of layered artifacts (single repository only)
   - SHA256: `6348821580749301aeb63f694dd34268b4eb0a8b97d1c550ff7567a7275e3d6a`

   - Updated Section 4: "Downward Ripple" → "Downward Layering"
   - Updated Section 5: "Upward Ripple" → "Upward Layering"
   - Updated Section 8: "Ripple Tracking" → "Layering and Rippling Tracking"
   - Updated Section 10: Agent Responsibilities (added Governance-Liaison role, clarified CS2 approval)

4. **.github/workflows/governance-ripple-dispatch.yml**
   - Renamed workflow title: "Governance Ripple Dispatch" → "Governance Layer-Down Dispatch"
   - Added terminology clarification comment at top
   - Renamed job: `dispatch-ripple` → `dispatch-layer-down`
   - Updated event type: `governance_ripple` → `governance_layer_down`
   - Updated console messages: "ripple" → "layer-down"
   - Updated recording path: `.agent-admin/ripple/` → `.agent-admin/layer-down/`

5. **governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json**
   - Regenerated with updated hashes for ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY.md (v1.1.0)
   - Regenerated with updated hashes for GOVERNANCE_RIPPLE_MODEL.md (v1.1.0)
   - Total canons: 176

### Actions Taken

1. **Wake-up Protocol**: Executed GA_H integrity checks
   - Verified CANON_INVENTORY.json structure
   - Located ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY.md
   - Identified governance/canon, governance/strategy, governance/ripple directories

2. **Terminology Audit**: Searched codebase for usage patterns
   - Found "layer down" correctly used in CROSS_REPOSITORY_LAYER_DOWN_PROTOCOL.md
   - Found "layer up" correctly used in LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL.md
   - Found "ripple" used for BOTH cross-repo and within-repo (confusion source)
   - Found ASSISTED_RIPPLE_SCAN_SCOPE.md correctly using "within a single repository"
   - Found workflow using "ripple" for cross-repo dispatch (incorrect)

3. **Canon Updates**: Precise definitions and terminology fixes
   - Updated ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY.md with three new canonical definitions
   - Clarified GOVERNANCE_RIPPLE_MODEL.md to distinguish layering (cross-repo) from rippling (within-repo)
   - Preserved historical "ripple" in section headers for continuity, clarified inline

4. **Strategy Document Creation**: Comprehensive automation guidance
   - Defined precise operational meanings for all three terms
   - Documented auto layer-down workflow (Phase 2 implementation)
   - Documented rippling workflow with CS2 escalation requirements
   - Provided clear escalation criteria (agent files require CS2 approval)
   - Included future automation roadmap (Phase 3-4)

5. **Workflow Fixes**: Aligned automation with correct terminology
   - Updated workflow name and job names
   - Updated event type from `governance_ripple` to `governance_layer_down`
   - Updated file paths and console messages
   - Added clarifying comment referencing canonical definitions

6. **Inventory Maintenance**: Regenerated CANON_INVENTORY.json
   - Updated ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY.md entry (v1.1.0)
   - Updated GOVERNANCE_RIPPLE_MODEL.md entry (v1.1.0)
   - Verified full SHA256 hashes (no placeholders)

### Decisions Made

1. **Terminology Preservation**: Kept GOVERNANCE_RIPPLE_MODEL.md filename
   - Rationale: Historical continuity, document now clarifies scope internally
   - Alternative considered: Rename to GOVERNANCE_LAYERING_MODEL.md (rejected for broader scope)

2. **Workflow File Rename**: Updated name but kept filename
   - Updated: Workflow title and job names for clarity
   - Preserved: Filename `governance-ripple-dispatch.yml` (can be renamed in future PR)
   - Rationale: Minimize file moves in this PR, focus on content clarity

3. **Strategy Document Location**: Created in governance/strategy/
   - Rationale: Operational strategy, not constitutional canon
   - Layer-Down Status: PUBLIC_API (must layer down to consumer repos)

4. **CS2 Approval Requirements**: Explicit escalation for agent contract rippling
   - Auto-close ripple: Non-agent files, LOCKED section sync only
   - Require CS2: Agent behavioral changes, authority boundary modifications
   - Rationale: Protects agent contract integrity, aligns with CS2_AGENT_FILE_AUTHORITY_MODEL.md

5. **Bidirectional Tracking**: Enhanced tracking to include rippling status
   - Layer-down tracked: Cross-repo distribution
   - Layer-up tracked: Cross-repo feedback
   - Rippling tracked: Within-repo integration (new)
   - Rationale: Complete audit trail for entire process

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

### Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ **Step 1: Investigate Terminology Usage**
- Audited governance canons, scripts, workflows
- Identified inconsistent usage (ripple for both cross-repo and within-repo)

✅ **Step 2: Precise Definitions and Canon Update**
- Updated ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY.md v1.1.0 with three canonical definitions
- Layering Down: Cross-repo distribution (Governance → Consumer)
- Layering Up: Cross-repo feedback (Consumer → Governance)
- Rippling: Within-repo integration (single repository only)

✅ **Step 3: Fix Terminology and Code/Script Usage**
- Updated GOVERNANCE_RIPPLE_MODEL.md to clarify cross-repo (layering) vs within-repo (rippling)
- Updated workflow comments and job names to use correct terminology
- Event type changed: `governance_ripple` → `governance_layer_down`

✅ **Step 4: Implement Auto Layering and Auto Rippling Strategy**
- Created comprehensive LAYERING_AND_RIPPLING_AUTOMATION_STRATEGY.md
- Documented auto layer-down process (GitHub issues to consumer repos)
- Documented rippling process with CS2 escalation requirements
- Defined escalation criteria: Agent files require CS2 approval; non-agent files auto-close
- Included future automation roadmap (Phases 2-4)

### Next Steps (CS2 Review)

**CS2 Approval Required**:
- Review ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY.md v1.1.0 new definitions
- Review GOVERNANCE_RIPPLE_MODEL.md v1.1.0 terminology clarification
- Review LAYERING_AND_RIPPLING_AUTOMATION_STRATEGY.md automation approach
- Approve escalation criteria for rippling (agent files → CS2 gate)

**Post-Approval**:
- Merge PR to main
- Execute layer-down to all consumer repos per LAYERING_AND_RIPPLING_AUTOMATION_STRATEGY.md Section 10.2
- Consumer repos update GOVERNANCE_ALIGNMENT_INVENTORY.json
- Consumer repos execute rippling per new protocol

## Lessons

### What Worked Well

1. **Systematic Audit**: Searching across governance/canon, scripts, and workflows revealed all usage patterns
2. **Terminology Precision**: Adding canonical definitions to ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY.md provides authoritative reference
3. **Strategy Document**: Comprehensive strategy document captures automation vision and escalation boundaries
4. **Inventory Integrity**: Regenerating CANON_INVENTORY.json ensures full SHA256 hashes and version tracking

### What Was Challenging

1. **Historical Terminology**: "Ripple" historically meant "governance evolution" (bidirectional), now split into layering (cross-repo) and rippling (within-repo)
2. **Workflow Renaming**: Balancing file rename (minimized) vs content clarity (maximized)
3. **Scope Clarity**: GOVERNANCE_RIPPLE_MODEL.md now covers both layering and rippling; considered rename but preserved for continuity

### What Future Sessions Should Know

1. **Terminology Authority**: ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY.md v1.1.0 is authoritative source for layering/rippling definitions
2. **Automation Strategy**: LAYERING_AND_RIPPLING_AUTOMATION_STRATEGY.md defines current (Phase 2) and future automation
3. **CS2 Gate**: Agent contract rippling ALWAYS requires CS2 approval if behavioral changes involved
4. **Layer-Down Required**: Both updated canons are PUBLIC_API → layer down to all consumer repos mandatory
5. **Workflow Event Type**: Consumer repos should listen for `governance_layer_down` event (was `governance_ripple`)

### Governance Insights

1. **Terminology Drift Prevention**: Adding terms to ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY.md prevents future confusion
2. **Clear Automation Boundaries**: Explicit CS2 escalation criteria protects agent contract integrity
3. **Bidirectional Tracking**: Tracking layer-down, layer-up, AND rippling provides complete audit trail
4. **Evolution Without Renaming**: GOVERNANCE_RIPPLE_MODEL.md clarified scope without filename change (continuity preserved)
5. **Strategy-First Approach**: Creating automation strategy document BEFORE implementing automation ensures alignment
