## Actions Taken

- Changed event_type from governance-ripple to governance_ripple in .github/workflows/governance-ripple-dispatch.yml line 53

## Decisions Made

- Single-line minimal change to align with CROSS_REPO_RIPPLE_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL.md canonical specification

## Lessons Learned

- GitHub repository_dispatch event types must use underscores not hyphens

## Patterns Observed

- Workflow implementations must exactly match canonical protocol specifications
