# Session 010 - 20260211 (Living Agent System v5.0.0)

## Task
Implement New Canons: OPOJD 2.0, Cross-Agent Coordination, and Ignorance Prohibition (Issue #[TBD])

## What I Did

### Files Modified (Auto-populated)
  - No files modified since last commit

### Canon Files Created (3 NEW Constitutional Canons):
1. **governance/opojd/OPOJD_COMPLETE_JOB_HANDOVER_DOCTRINE.md** (v2.0)
   - Constitutional upgrade to OPOJD v1.0
   - Mandates complete job handover (zero tolerance for partial work)
   - Pre-handover self-validation checklist
   - Stop-and-Fix integration
   - Mandatory improvement capture
   - No-excuse policy

2. **governance/coordination/CROSS_AGENT_COORDINATION_PROTOCOL.md** (v1.0)
   - Canonical cross-agent coordination process
   - Boundary detection and navigation
   - Coordination vs delegation distinction
   - Templates and decision trees
   - Sandbox clarity requirements

3. **governance/agent/AGENT_IGNORANCE_PROHIBITION_DOCTRINE.md** (v1.0)
   - Zero tolerance for ignorance-based failures
   - 8 ignorance categories defined
   - Proactive prevention requirements
   - Merge gate integration
   - Enforcement model (education → escalation → suspension)

### Inventory Updates
- ✅ GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md updated
  - Added OPOJD v2.0 entry in OPOJD section
  - Created new Coordination section with entry
  - Created new Agent Policies section with entry
- ✅ governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json updated
  - Total canons: 132 → 135
  - Added 3 entries with SHA256 hashes
  - JSON validated

### Canon Changes
- Canon modified: Yes - 3 NEW CANONS CREATED - RIPPLE REQUIRED!
- 3 NEW constitutional canons created (all PUBLIC_API)
- All cross-referenced with existing canons (OPOJD v1.0, Stop-and-Fix, BUILD_PHILOSOPHY, etc.)

### Directory Structure Created
- Created governance/coordination/ directory
- Created governance/agent/ directory

## Living Agent System v5.0.0 Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: .agent-workspace/governance-repo-administrator/evidence-20260211.log
- Status: 154 evidence entries collected

### Ripple Status
- Status: Last ripple: [2026-02-09 11:32] FM Merge Gate Management Canon (3 files) → R_Roster (NOTIFIED)
- Ripple required: YES (3 new PUBLIC_API canons)
- Ripple log updated with detailed plan
- Consumer repos: maturion-foreman-office-app, PartPulse, R_Roster
- Priority: CRITICAL/HIGH (constitutional changes)
- Estimated effort per repo: 4-6 hours (agent contract updates required)

### Governance Gap Progress (Issue #1047)
- Status: Not applicable to this task

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: No hygiene issues detected

## Code Review and Security
- ✅ Code review completed: No issues found
- ✅ CodeQL security scan: N/A (documentation only)

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

All deliverables met:
- [x] 3 new constitutional canons created with production-grade quality
- [x] All canons include examples, enforcement rules, metrics
- [x] All cross-references complete
- [x] GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md updated
- [x] CANON_INVENTORY.json updated (135 canons)
- [x] Merge gate integration specified
- [x] Ripple requirements documented
- [x] Code review passed
- [x] Security validation passed

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
1. **Comprehensive Planning**: Initial plan with detailed checklist kept work organized
2. **Parallel Canon Development**: Created all 3 canons with consistent structure and quality
3. **Constitutional Authority**: All canons have supreme authority status
4. **Cross-Reference Integration**: All canons reference each other and existing governance
5. **Examples and Enforcement**: Each canon includes practical examples and enforcement mechanisms
6. **Ripple Planning**: Detailed ripple plan prepared for consumer repos

### Challenges Addressed
1. **Directory Structure**: Created new directories (coordination/, agent/) for proper organization
2. **Inventory Management**: Successfully updated both MD and JSON inventory files
3. **SHA256 Generation**: Generated and verified hashes for all new canons
4. **Ripple Complexity**: Documented extensive ripple requirements due to constitutional nature

### Key Insights
1. **Constitutional Impact**: These canons fundamentally change agent behavior and requirements
2. **Agent Contract Updates**: All consumer repos will need significant agent contract updates
3. **Merge Gate Changes**: Consumer repos need to update gates to validate new requirements
4. **Evidence Bundle Evolution**: Evidence bundles need new sections for improvements and coordination

### For Future Sessions
1. **Ripple Execution**: Next session should execute ripple notification to consumer repos
2. **Consumer Validation**: Monitor consumer repo implementations for compliance
3. **Metrics Collection**: Begin tracking OPOJD v2.0, coordination, and ignorance metrics
4. **Agent Contract Templates**: Consider creating updated agent contract templates

### Continuous Improvement Captured
- Process: Wake-up protocol worked well for this complex task
- Tooling: grep/view/edit tools efficient for inventory updates
- Governance: Consider creating "constitutional canon checklist" for future high-impact canons
- Knowledge: Document canon creation patterns for consistency
