# Session 013 - 20260211 (Living Agent System v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: governance-repo-administrator
- Class: administrator
- Session ID: 20260211-123544
- Branch: copilot/update-agent-edit-protocol

## Task
Update the governance protocol to require explicit CS2-issue-based authorization for all changes to agent contract files (.agent files). Add this requirement to all active agent contracts, governance documentation, and repository documentation.

## What I Did

### Files Modified (Auto-populated)

1. `.github/agents/governance-repo-administrator-v2.agent.md` 
   - Added prohibition: "No edits to this agent contract (.agent file) may occur except as specifically instructed by a CS2-approved issue"
   - Commit: 1eaf76c

2. `.github/agents/CodexAdvisor-agent.md`
   - Added prohibition: "No edits to this agent contract (.agent file) may occur except as specifically instructed by a CS2-approved issue"
   - Commit: 1eaf76c

3. `.github/agents/foreman.agent.md`
   - Added prohibition: "No edits to this agent contract (.agent file) may occur except as specifically instructed by a CS2-approved issue"
   - Commit: 1eaf76c

4. `README.md`
   - Added "Agent Contract Edit Protocol" section explaining CS2-issue requirement
   - Located in Agent Onboarding section for maximum visibility
   - Professional tone maintained while conveying importance
   - Commits: 1eaf76c, 2db2f33

5. `governance/canon/AGENT_CONTRACT_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md`
   - Added section 4.5 "CS2-Issue Authorization Requirement"
   - Comprehensive requirements, rationale, enforcement mechanisms
   - Clarified CS2 self-authorization language per code review feedback
   - Commits: 1eaf76c, 2db2f33

6. `governance/canon/CS2_AGENT_FILE_AUTHORITY_MODEL.md`
   - Added "CS2-Issue Authorization Requirement" section after Rationale
   - Included introductory context explaining universal application
   - Updated Level 0 CS2 authority section with issue authorization requirement
   - Commits: 1eaf76c, 2db2f33

### Actions Taken

1. **Wake-up Protocol**: Executed `.github/scripts/wake-up-protocol.sh` successfully - loaded identity, memories, governance state
2. **Repository Exploration**: Identified all active agent contract files (3) and relevant governance documentation
3. **Minimal Changes**: Added single prohibition line to each agent contract file
4. **Documentation Updates**: Added comprehensive sections to governance canon and README
5. **Code Review**: Ran automated code review, received 3 feedback items, addressed all for improved clarity
6. **Security Check**: Ran CodeQL - no issues (documentation-only changes)
7. **Memory Management**: Created this session memory file

### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Only update active agent files in `.github/agents/`, not legacy archived files
   - **Why**: Legacy files are archived and explicitly marked as not for current use per README.md in legacy directory

2. **Decision**: Add single prohibition line consistently across all agent files
   - **Why**: Maintains consistency, minimal change approach, clear and unambiguous

3. **Decision**: Add comprehensive governance documentation rather than just brief mentions
   - **Why**: CS2-issue requirement is a constitutional-level control requiring detailed rationale, requirements, and enforcement mechanisms

4. **Decision**: Address all code review feedback before proceeding to security check
   - **Why**: Code review identified clarity improvements that strengthen governance documentation

5. **Decision**: Place README section in "Agent Onboarding" area
   - **Why**: Maximum visibility to all users, agents, and contributors

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: Git commits with detailed messages
- Status: ✅ Complete - All changes committed and pushed

### Ripple Status
- Status: Not required - changes are governance repo internal documentation updates
- Ripple required: NO (documentation-only changes to governance repo)

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: ✅ Addressed - Gap closed by implementing CS2-issue authorization requirement
- Previous gap: No explicit requirement for CS2-issue authorization in agent contracts or documentation
- Now covered: All agent files, governance canon, and README document the requirement

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: ✅ Clean
- No hygiene issues detected
- All files follow existing patterns and conventions
- Consistent formatting maintained

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

All success criteria from the issue have been met:
- [x] All `.github/agents/*.md` files include the explicit CS2-issue-edit prohibition
- [x] Related governance/automation documents reflect the same rule
- [x] A summary/changelog provided documenting all affected files/sections
- [x] All repository participants and agents are covered by the new protocol

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Running wake-up protocol first provided clear context and governance state
- Using grep/view in parallel to explore repository efficiently
- Minimal change approach - single line addition to each agent file
- Code review tool provided actionable feedback for documentation clarity
- Committing in logical chunks (initial changes, then code review improvements)

### What Was Challenging
- Initial exploration to understand full scope of agent files and governance documentation
- Balancing thoroughness in governance documentation with minimal change principle
- Deciding appropriate level of detail for README vs governance canon files

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- Agent contract files follow YAML frontmatter + markdown body structure
- Prohibitions sections exist in all three active agent files
- Governance canon files are authoritative source for detailed governance rules
- README should provide high-level guidance with references to detailed canon
- Code review tool provides valuable feedback - always run before security checks
- Session memory files should be created before session-closure.sh execution

### Governance Insights
- CS2-issue authorization creates clear audit trail for all agent contract changes
- Universal application (all agents, automation, humans) prevents loopholes
- Documentation at multiple levels (agent files, governance canon, README) ensures visibility
- Self-authorization for CS2 maintains supreme authority while preserving traceability
- Prohibition statements in agent files provide runtime reference for agents
