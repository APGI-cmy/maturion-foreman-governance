# Session 057 - 20260225 (Living Agent System v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: governance-repo-administrator
- Class: administrator
- Session ID: session-057-20260225

## Task
Formal canonization (layer-up) of ISMS-origin Tier-2 artifacts from maturion-isms PR #366 (2026-02-21). Six files were already present in `governance/canon/` and `governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json` but lacked layer-up provenance metadata and had placeholder effective_date values. Task was to surgically update CANON_INVENTORY, add a CHANGELOG entry, and create this session memory.

## What I Did

### Files Modified (Auto-populated)

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json` | 5 entries updated (layer_up_status, layer_up_provenance, effective_date); 1 new checklist entry added; total_canons 182→183; last_updated 2026-02-25 |
| `governance/CHANGELOG.md` | New entry [ISMS-TIER2-CANONIZATION] - 2026-02-25 - [NON_BREAKING_ENHANCEMENT] added at top of Change History |
| `.agent-workspace/governance-repo-administrator/memory/session-057-20260225.md` | This file (session memory created) |

SHA256 of checklist file used: `54043b8a8eb00715a07bf97f3e68d675019aa3750d1af49a2b8cf0f1452ad37f`

### Actions Taken
1. **Verified current branch**: Confirmed on `copilot/canonize-tier-2-artifacts` (no direct main push)
2. **Computed SHA256**: `sha256sum governance/checklists/PLATFORM_AI_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md` → `54043b8a8eb00715a07bf97f3e68d675019aa3750d1af49a2b8cf0f1452ad37f`
3. **Inspected CANON_INVENTORY.json**: Confirmed 5 target entries existed in `canons` array; confirmed PLATFORM_AI_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md was absent
4. **Checked session memory**: Highest existing session was 056; used 057 for this session
5. **Updated CANON_INVENTORY.json** (Python script, surgical changes only):
   - PROXY_AUTHORITY_MODEL.md: effective_date "unknown"→"2026-02-21", added layer_up_status/provenance
   - AGENT_CREATION_BUNDLE_REQUIREMENTS.md: effective_date "YYYY-MM-DD"→"2026-02-21", added layer_up_status/provenance
   - SPECIALIST_KNOWLEDGE_MANAGEMENT.md: effective_date "unknown"→"2026-02-21", added layer_up_status/provenance
   - AGENT_REGISTRY_ARCHITECTURE.md: effective_date "unknown"→"2026-02-21", added layer_up_status/provenance
   - PLATFORM_AI_REQUIREMENTS.md: effective_date "2026-02-19" kept, added layer_up_status/provenance
   - PLATFORM_AI_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md: new entry added with full metadata
   - last_updated → "2026-02-25"; total_canons → 183
6. **Validated JSON**: `python3 -m json.tool governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json` — ✅ valid
7. **Added CHANGELOG entry**: [ISMS-TIER2-CANONIZATION] at top of Change History section
8. **Created session memory**: This file

### Decisions Made
- **PLATFORM_AI_REQUIREMENTS.md effective_date preserved**: The existing value "2026-02-19" was kept as instructed (this predates the PR but reflects when the content was authored). Only the layer_up fields were added.
- **total_canons incremented**: 182→183 because the checklist was a net-new inventory entry
- **No layer-down required**: The files themselves were unchanged; only inventory metadata was updated. No consumer repo ripple triggered.
- **Changelog entry ID**: Used `[ISMS-TIER2-CANONIZATION]` as a self-describing identifier for this provenance canonization work

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: CANON_INVENTORY.json updated with verified SHA256 hashes
- JSON validation: `python3 -m json.tool` passed — 0 errors
- Status: ✅ All 6 entries verified post-write

### Ripple Status
- Status: NO RIPPLE REQUIRED
- Ripple required: NO — file content unchanged; only inventory metadata updated. No consumer repos need notification.

### Governance Gap Progress
- Gap closed: CANON_INVENTORY entries for 5 ISMS-origin Tier-2 artifacts now have complete provenance per REQ-CM-002
- Gap closed: PLATFORM_AI_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md now formally registered in inventory

### Governance Hygiene
- Verified all edits are on `copilot/canonize-tier-2-artifacts` branch (not main)
- JSON remains valid after edits
- CHANGELOG entry follows established format with all required fields

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

All 6 inventory entries updated/created. CHANGELOG entry added. Session memory created. JSON validated. Ready for PR merge.

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Pre-investigation results provided in the task prompt saved significant time — no need to re-investigate
- Python script approach for CANON_INVENTORY edits was robust and surgical — touched only the 5 target entries plus the new checklist entry
- Parallel tool calls (branch check + SHA256 + inventory inspection + session memory list) accelerated execution significantly

### What Was Challenging
- The `canons` array key (not `constitutional_canon` or `artifacts`) needed confirmation — the root key structure differed from what the contract's Phase 2 induction script examples assumed. Always inspect actual structure first.

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- `governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json` uses a single `canons` array (not split by type). All artifact types (canon, checklist, etc.) live in this one array.
- When adding layer_up fields to existing entries, Python dict mutation preserves field order for existing fields; new fields append to end. This is acceptable JSON behavior.
- The CHANGELOG "Change History" section header is the correct insertion point for new entries (entries are newest-first).
- FAIL-ONLY-ONCE attestation: This session performed only inventory metadata updates and documentation changes — no constitutional canon semantic changes, no protected file modifications, no direct main pushes. All rules satisfied.

### Governance Insights
- Layer-up provenance should be recorded at the time of initial canonization, not retroactively. The gap here occurred because the original PR #366 canonized the files but didn't update CANON_INVENTORY with layer_up fields. Future canonization work should include this step in the same PR.
- `effective_date: "unknown"` and `effective_date: "YYYY-MM-DD"` are placeholder values that should trigger the same degraded-mode warning as placeholder hashes per the spirit of REQ-SS-004. Consider adding this check to `validate-canon-hashes.sh`.
