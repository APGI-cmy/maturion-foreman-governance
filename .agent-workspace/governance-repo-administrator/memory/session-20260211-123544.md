## Agent
- Type: governance-repo-administrator
- Session ID: 20260211-123544
- Branch: copilot/update-agent-edit-protocol

## Context
- Issue: CS2-approved issue per problem statement
- Purpose: Add CS2-issue authorization requirement to all agent contract files and governance documentation

## Actions Taken

- Added prohibition statement to three active agent contract files
- Updated governance canon documentation with comprehensive CS2-issue requirement
- Updated README with agent contract edit protocol section
- Ran code review and addressed all feedback
- Created session memory and archived old sessions

## Decisions Made

- Only updated active agent files not legacy archives - archived files are not for current use
- Added single prohibition line consistently across all agent files for minimal change approach
- Addressed all code review feedback to improve documentation clarity

## Lessons Learned

- Wake-up protocol provides critical context - always run first
- Code review tool provides valuable actionable feedback
- Minimal change approach worked well - single line addition per agent file

## Patterns Observed

- Governance changes require documentation at multiple levels for complete coverage
- Living Agent System memory rotation works well at 5 sessions
