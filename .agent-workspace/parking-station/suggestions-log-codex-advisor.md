| Date | Agent | Session | Phase | Suggestion | Evidence |
|------|-------|---------|-------|------------|----------|
| 2026-02-27 | CodexAdvisor-agent | session-007 | SESSION-END | IAA-INTEGRITY-INDEX-GAP: governance/quality/agent-integrity/INTEGRITY_INDEX.md does not include an entry for independent-assurance-agent.md. Once this PR is merged and CS2 approves, CS2 should add the baseline SHA256 hash for independent-assurance-agent.md to INTEGRITY_INDEX.md and commit a reference copy to governance/quality/agent-integrity/. | session-007-20260227.md |
