### Actions Taken

**Phase 1: Core Canonical Documents**
- Created AGENT_INVOCATION_AND_DELEGATION_PROTOCOL.md establishing mandatory invocation
- Created AGENT_RIGHTS_BOUNDARIES_AND_DUTIES_REGISTRY.md with MAY/MAY NOT/MUST DO/MUST INVOKE boundaries
- Created AGENT_HANDOVER_AND_QUALITY_PROTOCOL.md with three-tier structure
- Created AGENT_CREATIVE_OWNERSHIP_AND_IMPROVEMENT_DOCTRINE.md
- Created AGENT_MERGE_GATE_HANDOVER_ENHANCEMENT.md for quality gates

**Phase 2: Templates and Integration**
- Updated AGENT_CONTRACT.template.md with three-tier prompts
- Added Tier 1 (Role & General Governance), Tier 2 (Agent-Specific), Tier 3 (Pre-Handover) structure
- Integrated improvement capture requirements throughout

**Phase 3: Documentation and Guidance**
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with comprehensive change entry
- Updated CANON_INVENTORY.json (validated JSON, 163 documents)
- Updated GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md
- Created LIVING_AGENT_OPERATING_MODEL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md

**Phase 4: Quality Validation**
- Ran code_review tool (1 minor suggestion addressed)
- Ran codeql_checker (no vulnerabilities)
- Validated JSON syntax
- Calculated all SHA256 hashes
- Created PREHANDOVER_PROOF.md

### Decisions Made

**Decision 1: Three-Tier Governance Prompt Structure**
- **What**: Structured agent governance into 3 tiers (Role & General, Agent-Specific, Pre-Handover)
- **Why**: Provides clear hierarchy from general to specific, ensures all agents have consistent foundation while allowing specialization
- **Impact**: All agent contracts will follow this structure

**Decision 2: Mandatory Invocation (Not Optional)**
- **What**: Changed agent invocation from optional/advisory to mandatory
- **Why**: Prevents scope drift, authority violations, and accountability gaps
- **Impact**: Agents must formally delegate when work exceeds authority

**Decision 3: "If You See It, You Own It" Doctrine**
- **What**: Agents discovering problems must take action until resolved
- **Why**: Prevents ignored problems and creates accountability chain
- **Impact**: Cultural shift from "not my job" to proactive ownership

**Decision 4: Pre-Handover Duplicate Merge Gate Runs**
- **What**: Agents must run merge gates in workspace before PR submission
- **Why**: Catch failures early, prevent PR gate failures
- **Impact**: Requires workspace gate validation scripts in all repos

**Decision 5: 60-Day Transition Period**
- **What**: Gradual adoption from 2026-02-16 to 2026-04-17, full enforcement after
- **Why**: Allows agents and repos time to adapt without disruption
- **Impact**: Flexibility during transition, strict enforcement post-transition

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: All changes tracked in 4 git commits
- Status: COMPLETE
- Files: 13 total (5 new canonical, 8 updated/new supporting)

### Ripple Status
- Status: Ready for layer-down ripple
- Ripple required: YES (PUBLIC_API layer-down status for all 5 new documents)
- Next action: governance-liaison will execute ripple after CS2 approval

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: Major gaps addressed (authority boundaries, delegation mechanics, handover quality, improvement capture)
- Gaps closed:
  - Agent authority boundary ambiguities
  - Lack of formal delegation protocol
  - Missing accountability chain
  - Inconsistent handover quality
  - No systematic improvement capture
  - Test debt accumulation prevention

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: EXCELLENT
- CANON_INVENTORY.json: Valid JSON, 163 documents
- All SHA256 hashes calculated and stored
- Cross-references validated
- CHANGELOG comprehensive
- Implementation guidance complete

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

All requirements from issue implemented:
- [x] 5 new canonical governance documents created
- [x] Three-tier governance prompt structure defined
- [x] Mandatory invocation protocol established
- [x] Agent rights/boundaries/duties registry complete
- [x] Handover and quality protocol comprehensive
- [x] Creative ownership doctrine established
- [x] Merge gate enhancements defined
- [x] Agent contract template updated
- [x] Implementation guidance created
- [x] CANON_INVENTORY and artifact inventory updated
- [x] Code review and codeql_checker passed
- [x] Pre-handover proof complete

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- **Systematic approach**: Breaking implementation into clear phases (core docs → templates → documentation → validation)
- **Comprehensive examples**: Providing extensive examples and templates in canonical documents
- **Integration thinking**: Ensuring all 5 documents cross-reference each other
- **Beyond minimum delivery**: Not just creating documents but also implementation guide, migration guidance, and transition plan
- **Quality validation**: Running code_review and codeql_checker before handover

### What Was Challenging
- **Balancing comprehensiveness with clarity**: Documents are extensive (131KB total) but needed to be comprehensive
- **Ensuring consistency**: Maintaining consistent terminology (MAY/MAY NOT/MUST DO) across all 5 documents
- **Cross-referencing**: Ensuring all documents reference each other appropriately without circular dependencies

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- **Living Agent Operating Model is now canonical**: All future agent work must follow these protocols
- **Transition period active**: 60 days for gradual adoption (2026-02-16 to 2026-04-17)
- **Ripple required**: These changes require layer-down ripple to all consumer repos
- **Three-tier structure**: All agent contracts must be updated with Tier 1/2/3 structure
- **Improvement parking station**: New infrastructure for tracking improvements

### Governance Insights

**Insight 1: Agent Authority Boundaries Were Implicit**
- Previous state: Authority boundaries inferred from context
- New state: Explicit MAY/MAY NOT/MUST DO/MUST INVOKE registry
- Impact: Eliminates ambiguity, enables automated validation

**Insight 2: Accountability Can Be Delegated Away (Was Problem)**
- Previous state: Agents could blame delegated work for failures
- New state: OPOJD doctrine - accountability remains with delegating agent
- Impact: No blame-shifting, clear ownership chain

**Insight 3: Handovers Were Inconsistent**
- Previous state: Each agent had own handover approach
- New state: Three-tier structure with mandatory pre-handover requirements
- Impact: Consistent quality, systematic improvement capture

**Insight 4: Quality Erosion Through Test Debt**
- Previous state: Test debt accumulated (skipped, TODO, commented tests)
- New state: 8-category test debt detection, zero tolerance
- Impact: Quality maintained, no hidden debt

**Insight 5: Agents Are Intelligent Professionals**
- Previous state: Sometimes treated as mechanical executors
- New state: Creative ownership doctrine - think critically, own holistically
- Impact: Cultural shift toward intelligent, proactive agents
