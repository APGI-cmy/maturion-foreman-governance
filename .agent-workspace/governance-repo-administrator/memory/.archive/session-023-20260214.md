# Session 023 - 20260214 (Living Agent System v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: governance-repo-administrator
- Class: administrator
- Session ID: 20260214-104225

## Task
**CRITICAL RCA**: Fix catastrophic merge gate failure due to unregistered responsibility domain in scope-declaration.md

## What I Did

### Files Modified
- `governance/scope-declaration.md` - SHA256: (updated line 9)
  - Changed: `RESPONSIBILITY_DOMAIN: Canonical Governance Maintenance`
  - To: `RESPONSIBILITY_DOMAIN: Governance Administration`

### Actions Taken
- Action 1: Identified root cause - unregistered domain name in scope declaration
- Action 2: Verified correct domain name in RESPONSIBILITY_DOMAIN_REGISTRY.md (line 186)
- Action 3: Updated scope-declaration.md to use registered domain "Governance Administration"
- Action 4: Verified all file paths fall within allowed paths for this domain
- Action 5: Created session memory documenting RCA and learnings

### Decisions Made
- Decision 1: Immediate fix required - merge gate failure is catastrophic and blocks handover
- Decision 2: Use "Governance Administration" domain (not propose new domain) - follows registry guidance
- Decision 3: Document this as anti-pattern to prevent future occurrences

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: RCA documented in PREHANDOVER_PROOF.md and this session memory
- Status: Critical fix applied, ready for re-validation

### Ripple Status
- Status: N/A - This is a fix to existing PR, not a new canon change
- Ripple required: NO

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: Critical gap identified and remediated
- Gap: Insufficient validation of responsibility domain names during scope declaration creation

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: Issue detected and fixed
- Issue: Unregistered domain name used in scope declaration

## Root Cause Analysis

### What Went Wrong
**Symptom**: Merge gate failed with error "GOVERNANCE BLOCK: Responsibility domain 'Canonical Governance Maintenance' is not registered"

**Root Cause**: 
1. Used descriptive but unregistered domain name "Canonical Governance Maintenance"
2. Failed to cross-reference RESPONSIBILITY_DOMAIN_REGISTRY.md before declaring domain
3. No pre-commit validation to catch unregistered domain names

**Why It Happened**:
- Domain name seemed logically correct for the work being done
- Did not verify against registry before committing
- Assumed domain name could be descriptive rather than registry-compliant

### Fix Applied
- Changed `RESPONSIBILITY_DOMAIN: Canonical Governance Maintenance` 
- To: `RESPONSIBILITY_DOMAIN: Governance Administration`
- This matches line 186 of RESPONSIBILITY_DOMAIN_REGISTRY.md

### Verification
✅ Governance Administration domain allows paths:
- `.agent`
- `.agent-admin/**`
- `.github/agents/**`
- `.github/workflows/**`
- `governance/**`

✅ All changed files in this PR fall within `governance/**` path
✅ Domain is properly registered in the canonical registry

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE - Critical fix applied, ready for merge gate re-validation

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Rapid identification of root cause from error message
- Clear fix path - registry provided exact domain name
- Systematic RCA documentation

### What Was Challenging
- Discovering the failure after substantial work was complete
- Need to re-run all merge gate validations

### What Future Sessions Should Know
1. **ALWAYS verify responsibility domain against RESPONSIBILITY_DOMAIN_REGISTRY.md BEFORE creating scope-declaration.md**
2. **Use exact domain names from registry** - do not create descriptive variations
3. **Add pre-commit validation** for domain name verification (future enhancement)
4. **Registry is authoritative** - follow the process to propose new domains if needed

### Governance Insights
1. **Domain Registry Enforcement**: The governance scope validation gate correctly caught this error - gate is working as designed
2. **Registry Awareness**: Need better agent awareness of responsibility domain registry during scope declaration creation
3. **Pre-work Checklist**: Should include "Verify responsibility domain against registry" step
4. **Future Enhancement**: Consider CI check that validates domain names during PR creation (not just at merge)

## Prevention Measures

### Immediate Actions Taken
1. ✅ Fixed scope-declaration.md with correct domain name
2. ✅ Documented in session memory
3. ✅ Updated lessons-learned.md
4. ✅ Updated anti-patterns.md

### Future Improvements Recommended
1. Add "Verify Domain Against Registry" to pre-work checklist
2. Consider pre-commit hook for domain validation
3. Add CI check for scope-declaration.md domain validation (earlier in workflow)
4. Update scope-declaration.md template with registry reference comment
