## Task
Implement governance breach corrective actions following unauthorized agent contract file modification in `APGI-cmy/maturion-isms` PR #517. Establish strict constitutional prohibition against agents (other than CodexAdvisor with explicit CS2 permission) modifying `.github/agents/` contract files. Required outputs: updated canon, IAA audit workflow, incident documentation, ripple notice, CHANGELOG, CANON_INVENTORY updates.

### Actions Taken
1. Read FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md in full and self-attested against all rules — no violations detected at session start
2. Read wake-up context: LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md, AGENT_HANDOVER_AUTOMATION.md, CANON_INVENTORY.json, CONSUMER_REPO_REGISTRY.json, GATE_REQUIREMENTS_INDEX.json
3. Read incident context: session-055 (previous ripple that directly patched agent contracts), AGENT_CONTRACT_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md, IAA canon
4. Created `AGENT_CONTRACT_FILE_PROTECTION_POLICY.md` v1.0.0 — comprehensive constitutional policy document
5. Updated `LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md` — prohibition #1 strengthened + new protection section
6. Updated `AGENT_HANDOVER_AUTOMATION.md` §4.3 — added prohibition + CodexAdvisor handoff pathway
7. Created `.github/workflows/agent-contract-audit.yml` — IAA audit CI/CD enforcement
8. Created incident record for PR #517 breach
9. Created layer-down ripple notice for consumer repos
10. Updated CHANGELOG.md with `[AGCFPP-001]` entry (newest-first)
11. Updated CANON_INVENTORY.json with new entry and updated hashes
12. Updated FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md with breach log + Section D RCA rules
13. Created session memory (this file) and updated personal files

### Decisions Made
- **Decision 1**: Created dedicated policy document rather than just updating existing canon — the policy needed a standalone, referenceable, CS2-only-amendable artifact to serve as the constitutional anchor
- **Decision 2**: LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md and AGENT_HANDOVER_AUTOMATION.md updates are operational clarifications within GA authority per the CS2 issue directive; not semantic canon rewrites requiring separate CS2 approval
- **Decision 3**: CI/CD workflow enforces CS2 authorization reference check as gate condition; CodexAdvisor involvement check is WARNING (not blocking) when CS2 auth is present, to avoid blocking CS2 direct actions
- **Decision 4**: Treated session-055's agent contract patching as the same class of breach that triggered this issue — documented in incident record as "same pattern"
- **Decision 5**: Consumer repo ripple notice created but actual GitHub issues left for CS2 to create (consistent with cross-repo authority model — GA coordinates, does not execute consumer repo actions directly)
- **Decision 6**: FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md gets new Section D for RCA-derived rules (extending the standard Section A/B/C structure) — this makes RCA learnings machine-readable and structured

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: Inline in this session memory
- Status: COMPLETE

### FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Attestation
- Pre-session: ✅ Self-attested against all Universal Rules (A-01 to A-08) and Conditional Rules (B-01 to B-05) — no violations
- Post-session: B-06 added to FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md as per A-03

### Ripple Status
- Ripple required: YES (constitutional canon updated — LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md, AGENT_HANDOVER_AUTOMATION.md)
- In-repo status: ✅ COMPLETE (all governance repo artifacts updated)
- Consumer repo ripple: ⏳ PENDING — ripple notice + issue template created; CS2 to create GitHub issues

### Governance Gap Progress
- Gap addressed: Agents modifying .github/agents/ files without CodexAdvisor/CS2 authorization
- New policy document: governance/canon/AGENT_CONTRACT_FILE_PROTECTION_POLICY.md v1.0.0
- CI/CD enforcement: .github/workflows/agent-contract-audit.yml

### Governance Hygiene
- CANON_INVENTORY.json: Updated with correct hashes and new entry — no placeholder hashes
- CHANGELOG.md: Updated with AGCFPP-001 entry
- Protected files: Only syntactic/operational updates to canon (per CS2 issue directive)
- No direct main pushes: PR-only write

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE (governance side) — All corrective governance artifacts created and committed  
⏳ PENDING (remediation side) — CS2 to review PR #517 and create consumer repo layer-down issues

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Having a clear CS2-authorized directive made scope unambiguous
- The existing FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md structure was easy to extend with RCA-derived rules
- Creating a dedicated policy document rather than only updating existing canon provides a clean reference point
- The IAA audit checklist embedded in the policy makes the compliance standard operational

### What Was Challenging
- Balancing strictness (constitutional prohibition) with practicality (CS2 direct actions should not be blocked)
- Determining whether session-055's agent contract patching should be explicitly called out as a breach — decided yes, as it's the same pattern; referenced in incident record

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- `.github/agents/` files are now HARD PROHIBITED for direct GA modification — always check AGCFPP policy
- The agent-contract-audit.yml workflow requires CS2 authorization reference in PR descriptions for ALL agent contract changes
- IAA is a hard trigger on agent file changes — plan for IAA audit in the PR timeline
- Consumer repo ripple issues still pending — follow up with CS2 to create them

### Governance Insights
- Principle-level rules ("Zero Direct Writing") are insufficient without operational enforcement. Every major prohibition needs: dedicated policy doc + CI/CD enforcement + escalation pathway + incident documentation pathway
- The "same RCA pattern" recognition is valuable — session-055 doing the same thing as the maturion-isms breach helped me design the policy to cover the exact failure modes
- RCA-derived rules in FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md Section D make the learning actionable for future sessions
