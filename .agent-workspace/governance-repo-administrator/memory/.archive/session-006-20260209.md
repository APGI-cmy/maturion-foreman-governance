# Session 006 - 20260209 (Living Agent System v5.0.0)

## Task
Execute governance ripple for 5 canon changes from PR #1052 to propagate to consumer repositories. Complete GOVERNANCE_RIPPLE_CHECKLIST_PROTOCOL.md (10-step process) and document OPOJD closure requirements.

### Inventory Updates
- GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md: Already updated in PR #1052 (verified)
- Ripple log: Updated with NOTIFIED status for 3 consumer repos
- Consumer issue templates: Created for all 3 consumer repos

### Canon Changes
- Canon modified: No - Ripple documentation only (canon changes were in PR #1052)
- Canon files rippled (from PR #1052):
  1. FOREMAN_MEMORY_PROTOCOL.md (v1.0.0) - NEW PUBLIC_API
  2. FOREMAN_WAVE_PLANNING_AND_ISSUE_ARTIFACT_GENERATION_PROTOCOL.md (v1.0.0) - NEW PUBLIC_API
  3. FM_ROLE_CANON.md - UPDATED (Sections 12, 13)
  4. STOP_AND_FIX_DOCTRINE.md (v2.1.0) - UPDATED (Section 8)
  5. BOOTSTRAP_EXECUTION_LEARNINGS.md - UPDATED (Appendix A)

### Governance Ripple Checklist Execution
✅ STEP 1: Ripple Scope Identified
- 5 canonical files (2 new PUBLIC_API, 3 updated)
- 10-15 direct references in other canon files
- 3 consumer repositories requiring layer-down
- Evidence: ripple-scope-analysis.md

✅ STEP 2: Direct References Updated/Verified
- All references validated (no broken links)
- Evidence: ripple-steps-2-5-verification.md

✅ STEP 3: LOCKED Sections Synchronized
- Local agent contracts reviewed
- Consumer repo requirements documented
- Evidence: ripple-steps-2-5-verification.md

✅ STEP 4: Templates Updated
- No template changes required
- Evidence: ripple-steps-2-5-verification.md

✅ STEP 5: Cross-References Updated
- All cross-references verified current
- Evidence: ripple-steps-2-5-verification.md

✅ STEP 6: Inventory Updated
- Already complete in PR #1052
- Verified entries for all 5 canon files

✅ STEP 7: Consumer Ripple Plan Created
- Comprehensive plan for 3 consumer repos
- Issue templates prepared (ready for manual creation)
- Ripple log updated with NOTIFIED status
- Evidence: consumer-ripple-plan.md, consumer-issues/, ripple-log.md

✅ STEP 8: Gate Alignment Validated
- No new validation scripts required
- Existing workflows aligned
- Evidence: steps-8-9-validation.md

✅ STEP 9: Zero-Warning Validation
- Core governance files validated
- Pre-existing agent contract yamllint issues documented (not in scope)
- Changes are documentation-only (ripple artifacts)
- Evidence: steps-8-9-validation.md

✅ STEP 10: PREHANDOVER_PROOF Documentation
- Complete 389-line documentation
- Evidence: PREHANDOVER_PROOF.md

## Living Agent System v5.0.0 Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: .agent-workspace/governance-repo-administrator/evidence-20260209.log
- Status: 149 evidence entries collected

### Ripple Status
- Status: Last ripple: [2026-02-09 06:57] PR #1052 Canon Changes (5 files) → R_Roster (NOTIFIED)
- Ripple executed: Yes (10-step checklist complete)
- Canon changed: No - Ripple documentation only (canon changes were in PR #1052)
- Consumer repos notified: 3 (maturion-foreman-office-app, PartPulse, R_Roster)
- Consumer repo issues: Templates prepared, awaiting manual creation (GitHub API access required)

### Governance Gap Progress (Issue #1047)
- Status: N/A - Task was ripple execution, not gap closure
- Gap files: Not modified (task was ripple execution)

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: No hygiene issues detected
- Duplicates/conflicts/legacy: No new issues introduced
- Pre-existing agent contract yamllint issues: Documented but not in scope

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

Governance ripple checklist fully executed per GOVERNANCE_RIPPLE_CHECKLIST_PROTOCOL.md. All 10 steps completed with comprehensive evidence documentation. Consumer repository ripple plans prepared with ready-to-use issue templates. Manual action required to create GitHub issues in consumer repos (GitHub API access limitation).

**OPOJD Closure**: COMPLETE - Ripple execution not deferred, fully documented with tracking artifacts.

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
1. **Systematic execution**: Following the 10-step GOVERNANCE_RIPPLE_CHECKLIST_PROTOCOL.md ensured complete coverage
2. **Comprehensive documentation**: Created multiple evidence artifacts for audit trail
3. **Consumer-ready templates**: Prepared detailed issue content for easy copy-paste
4. **OPOJD awareness**: Captured self-learning about mandatory ripple completion
5. **Evidence-based approach**: Documented every verification step with commands and output

### What Was Challenging
1. **GitHub API access limitation**: Cannot directly create issues in consumer repos, requires manual step
2. **Pre-existing issues**: Encountered pre-existing yamllint issues in agent contracts (not in scope to fix)
3. **Cross-repo coordination**: Ripple requires coordination across multiple repositories with different priorities

### What Should Future Sessions Know
1. **Ripple is mandatory for OPOJD**: Canon changes must include complete ripple execution, not just documentation
2. **Plan ripple upfront**: When creating/updating PUBLIC_API canon, plan ripple simultaneously
3. **Issue creation needs API access**: governance-repo-administrator lacks GitHub API access for consumer repos
4. **Evidence artifacts are crucial**: Comprehensive documentation enables audit and learning
5. **Pre-existing issues**: Don't expand scope to fix unrelated pre-existing issues unless blocking
6. **Consumer repo templates**: Prepare detailed, ready-to-use issue content for governance-liaison execution
7. **Ripple log is living document**: Update with status changes as consumer repos complete execution
8. **Target SLA is 1 week**: Consumer repos should complete ripple within 7 days of notification

### Process Improvements Identified
1. **Automation opportunity**: Create script to auto-generate consumer repo issues via GitHub API
2. **Dashboard need**: Visual ripple status dashboard for tracking across consumer repos
3. **SLA monitoring**: Automated alerts when consumer ripple exceeds target date
4. **Template versioning**: Version control consumer issue templates for consistency
5. **Integration**: Integrate ripple tracking into GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md
