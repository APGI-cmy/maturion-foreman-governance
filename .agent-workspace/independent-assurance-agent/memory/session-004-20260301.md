## Agent Integrity Results
- INV-501 to INV-503: N/A — no agent files changed in this PR
- INV-504: PASS (⚠️ ESC-002 ACTIVE) — check performed; pre-existing drift unchanged from prior session
- ESC-002 remains open (filed session-003-20260301.md); no new drift introduced by this PR

---

## Overlay Results
- Overlay D (Merge Gate Workflow): PASS — no gates weakened; yaml-lint job adds protection only
- Overlay E (Governance Docs — light): PASS — handover proof present
- Overlay F (Learning Loop): EXECUTED — see below

---

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Checks
| Rule | Result |
|------|--------|
| A-004 | PASS — bootstrap directive followed |
| A-005 | PASS — no .github/agents/ files in diff |
| A-006 | PASS — iaa_audit_token: PENDING (legitimate) |
| A-016 | N/A — PENDING token, not a real session token |
| A-017 | N/A — PENDING token |
| A-018 | PASS — IAA invoked for .github/workflows/ PR |

---

## Intelligence-Led Synthesis
- Substance over form: CONFIRMED — all four artifacts are delivery-specific, non-boilerplate
- Delivery-appropriate depth: CONFIRMED — 4-file 278-line PR; evidence bundle proportionate
- Truthfulness: CONFIRMED — every substantive claim independently verified (hash script, filesystem, GitHub API, git diff)
- Pattern recognition: A-09 recurring breach (GA invokes IAA retroactively) is 2nd occurrence for PR #1255 context and was already handled in session-003; remediation confirmed this session

---

## Binary Verdict
**ASSURANCE-TOKEN issued.**
Verdict artifact: `.agent-admin/assurance/assurance-token-1255.md`
Token reference: IAA-20260301-PR1255-R2-PASS

Rationale: All invariants in Sections 1-6 PASS or N/A. Independence confirmed. Prior REJECTION-PACKAGE
(IAA-20260301-PR1255) all 6 blocking items resolved. Evidence artifacts substantive and claims verified.
Gate parity check (INV-405 BLOCKING) independently verified: 0 hash failures, 0 open blockers, PR not in draft.

## Recurring Shortfalls Detected

| Pattern | Prior Occurrences | This Session | Action |
|---------|------------------|--------------|--------|
| GA commits before invoking IAA (A-09 breach) | session-002/PR #1253 (1st) + session-003/PR #1255 (2nd) | REMEDIATED — GA followed process correctly in resubmission | A-09 already in GA FAIL-ONLY-ONCE (session-003); pattern continues at 2 total occurrences |
| Evidence artifacts untracked at IAA invocation time | session-003/PR #1255 (1st, REJECTION) | session-004/PR #1255-R2 — artifacts exist but untracked | No invariant explicitly requires git commitment; merge gate CI would catch. Note for future: consider whether "artifacts committed to branch" should be a distinct INV check |

**Escalation check (OVF-003):** The A-09 breach pattern was first seen in session-002 and recurred in session-003 (pre-remediation). The remediation in this session is working correctly. The pattern has not recurred a third time in the remediated form. No three-peat escalation needed.

## 🔄 LEARNING LOOP (MANDATORY — INV-601 to INV-605)

### INV-601: Session memory created
This file: `.agent-workspace/independent-assurance-agent/memory/session-004-20260301.md` ✅

### INV-602: Concrete improvement suggestion (MANDATORY — NEVER BLANK)

**Suggestion 1 — Add explicit CHANGELOG status to handover proof template**
The INV-408 check ("Handover proof states whether CHANGELOG was updated for governance changes") required a substance-over-form judgment in this session because the handover proof had no explicit CHANGELOG section. While the decision was clearly correct (workflow+docs PR; no canon change; N/A), having an explicit line in the template would eliminate the ambiguity. Suggested addition to prehandover_proof template:
```
## CHANGELOG Status
- CHANGELOG update required: YES / NO
- Rationale: [e.g. "workflow-only PR; no canon changes; governance CHANGELOG N/A"]
```
This would convert INV-408 from a substance-over-form judgment to a mechanical check. Priority: LOW.

**Suggestion 2 — Add git-committed status check to merge prerequisite documentation**
Evidence artifacts were untracked at the time of IAA invocation. This is a predictable pattern in the workflow (GA creates → IAA verifies → GA commits with final token). However, no invariant catches it explicitly. Either:
(a) Add INV-410: "Evidence artifacts and handover proof committed to branch" (PASS = artifacts in `git status --short` show no `??` for evidence paths), or
(b) Accept the current workflow and rely on the merge gate CI to enforce commitment.
Option (b) is likely sufficient since the merge gate does check for prehandover proof existence (via checkout). But note: the merge gate currently passes if ANY prior prehandover proof exists in the repo (not necessarily PR-specific). This could be a governance trail gap. Priority: MEDIUM — consider for Tier-2 invariant addition.

**Suggestion 3 — Update IAA wake-up protocol script to support `.md` naming convention**
`wake-up-protocol.sh` looks for `independent-assurance-agent.agent.md` but the file is named `independent-assurance-agent.md`. The script fails silently (outputs an error but continues). Either rename the IAA contract file to include `.agent.` or update the script to accept both naming conventions. Priority: LOW.

### INV-603: Recurring shortfall promotion check
The A-09 breach (GA commits before IAA invocation) has been seen in sessions 002, 003, and remediated in 004. This was already promoted to GA FAIL-ONLY-ONCE in session-003. No additional promotion needed for IAA's own registry. However, the "evidence artifacts untracked at IAA invocation" pattern is a FIRST OBSERVATION in this session — not ready for promotion. Track for next occurrence.

### INV-604: Verdict recorded
ASSURANCE-TOKEN issued (IAA-20260301-PR1255-R2). Rationale documented in Binary Verdict section above.

### INV-605: No REJECTION-PACKAGE issued this session — no tracking entry required.

### INV-606: N/A — no REJECTION-PACKAGE issued.

### INV-607: Resubmission protocol executed — prior REJECTION-PACKAGE verified, all items resolved, acknowledgement confirmed. Documented in Resubmission Protocol section above.

## Prior Session Improvement Suggestions Review (OVF-005)

| Session | Suggestion | Status |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| session-001-20260226 | "IAA agent contract file verification" | DEFERRED — not triggered this session (no agent file changes) |
| session-002-20260301 | "IAA invocation must be integrated into GA Phase 4 handover script" | PARTIALLY ACTIONED — GA has A-09 in FAIL-ONLY-ONCE; architectural integration into Phase 4 handover script remains deferred. The A-09 breach pattern persisted from session-002 to session-003 before being remediated. This remains a high-priority improvement. |
| session-003-20260301 | "A-09 pattern: require pre-commit IAA invocation (FAIL-ONLY-ONCE promotion)" | ACTIONED — A-09 breach recorded in GA FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Section C (this session). IAA FAIL-ONLY-ONCE could gain a corresponding A-series rule for detecting pre-committed PRs at IAA invocation. Deferred to future learning loop. |

## Outcome

✅ ASSURANCE-TOKEN ISSUED — IAA-20260301-PR1255-R2
Verdict artifact: `.agent-admin/assurance/assurance-token-1255.md`
Session memory: `.agent-workspace/independent-assurance-agent/memory/session-004-20260301.md` (this file)

Post-assurance actions (submitting agent — governance-repo-administrator):
1. Commit all untracked evidence artifacts to branch
2. Update iaa_audit_token in handover proof: PENDING → IAA-20260301-PR1255-R2-PASS
3. Commit and push final commit
4. PR ready for CS2 review and merge

ESC-002 (agent integrity drift): Remains open — awaiting CS2 action.
