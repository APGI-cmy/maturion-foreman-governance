@copilot — CS2 security fix applied directly to this branch. Please review the change and confirm it is correct before this PR is merged.

## What was fixed — `detect-hitl-approval` step (lines 94–96 → `env:` block)

`COMMENTER` and `COMMENT_BODY` were previously interpolated **inline** inside the `run:` script:

```yaml
# BEFORE (vulnerable to script injection)
run: |
  COMMENTER="${{ github.event.comment.user.login }}"
  COMMENT_BODY="${{ github.event.comment.body }}"
```

A comment body containing `$(...)`, backticks, or shell metacharacters could execute arbitrary code in the runner. This is the same injection class fixed in `layer-up-trigger.yml` (PR #698 in maturion-isms).

The fix moves both values to the `env:` block, matching the established pattern:

```yaml
# AFTER (safe — content passed through environment, not interpolated into script)
env:
  CS2_ACTORS: "APGI-cmy johanras maturion-bot"
  # Security: user-supplied content passed via env: — never inline in run: scripts
  COMMENTER: ${{ github.event.comment.user.login }}
  COMMENT_BODY: ${{ github.event.comment.body }}
run: |
  echo "commenter=${COMMENTER}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
  COMMENT_FIRST_LINE=$(echo "${COMMENT_BODY}" | head -1)
  ...
```

## Scope

**Only** the `detect-hitl-approval` step was changed. All workflow logic, branch names, labels, job structure, and downstream steps are identical to the previous commit.

## Verification checklist for @copilot

Please verify:
1. ✅ `COMMENTER` and `COMMENT_BODY` are now in the `env:` block — not interpolated inline in `run:`
2. ✅ All shell references to `${COMMENTER}` and `${COMMENT_BODY}` in the `run:` script still work correctly as environment variables
3. ✅ The `CS2_ACTORS` env var is still present and unchanged
4. ✅ No other injection-vulnerable `${{ github.event.comment.* }}` inline interpolations remain in this file
5. ✅ All four job branches (Gate 1, Gate 2, Branch A, Branch B, Branch C) are structurally intact

Once verified, this PR is **approved and ready to merge**.
