# Session 001 - 20260211 (Living Agent System v5.0.0)

## Agent
- Type: CodexAdvisor-agent
- Class: Governance advisor / overseer
- Session ID: 001

## Task
Create FOREMAN_REQUIREMENTS artifacts (JSON + MD) mirroring the governance-repo-administrator requirements structure with foreman-specific metadata and workspace paths.

## What I Did
### Files Modified (Auto-populated)
- governance/contracts/FOREMAN_REQUIREMENTS.json (sha256: 2746f1f86dd9660ecbf7f6ecef35b185d3b7f36d4215949e259013c9da299c4c)
- governance/contracts/FOREMAN_REQUIREMENTS.md (sha256: 628e6d2b24a4798142d53a02cb7f2fdcb04e170b747557b5a579018afce652a9)
- .agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/personal/lessons-learned.md (sha256: 3f7b03657eb1fe14689f5322d334eb3040f84d59590dad704722c783e96a153c)
- .agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/personal/patterns.md (sha256: c6ba69f9c4c22132da4c6c9075fa0332355c42baa9b610dbedad3d3569d6d279)
- .agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/memory/session-001-20260211.md (sha256: 835ee6a7a2d82649a1e2d6407936f7b748109fb249f5c260d3cf4fdc7ccfa95f)

### Actions Taken
- Ran wake-up protocol; noted missing CodexAdvisor agent contract and proceeded in degraded mode.
- Duplicated governance-repo-administrator requirement artifacts to new foreman JSON/MD with updated metadata, scope, and workspace paths.
- Validated FOREMAN_REQUIREMENTS.json with `jq empty`.
- Updated personal lessons and patterns to capture wake-up failure and templated duplication approach.

### Decisions Made
- Proceeded with templated duplication to maintain structure and counts while aligning metadata to foreman scope due to limited foreman-specific requirement inventory.
- Documented degraded wake-up state instead of blocking work because the missing contract is outside current task scope.

## Living Agent System v5.0.0 Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: n/a (no additional logs beyond git history)
- Status: Captured hashes for modified files; jq validation completed.

### Ripple Status
- Status: No ripple triggered (documentation-only artifacts).
- Ripple required: NO

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: Identified missing CodexAdvisor agent contract during wake-up; noted for escalation if required.

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: Operated in degraded mode due to missing agent contract; otherwise followed minimal-change and validation steps.

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

## Lessons
### What Worked Well
- Rapid duplication of existing requirements artifacts preserved structure and minimized divergence.
- Early validation with `jq` avoided syntax regressions.

### What Was Challenging
- Wake-up protocol failed because the CodexAdvisor agent contract is absent.
- Limited foreman-specific requirement inventory required reuse of existing structure.

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- Confirm agent contracts exist before running wake-up to avoid degraded mode.
- When new agent artifacts mirror existing ones, copy and adjust metadata and workspace paths to reduce risk.

### Governance Insights
- Missing governance contracts should be escalated or restored to exit degraded mode.
- Consistent checklist formats across agents aid validation and automation.
