## Task
Add comprehensive delegation guidance section to canonical FOREMAN_AUTHORITY_AND_SUPERVISION_MODEL.md, update CANON_INVENTORY.json, and prepare auto-ripple notification to consumer repositories.

**Issue**: [Governance Canon Update] Add Delegation Guidance Section to FOREMAN_AUTHORITY_AND_SUPERVISION_MODEL.md & Auto-Ripple

**Strategic Context**: 2026-02-15 strategic decision identified need for explicit delegation guidance in Foreman agent contracts to support architecture-first, QA-first execution model during MAT (Maturion App Template) build phase.

- Changes: Created comprehensive ripple signal document (329 lines, 14,259 chars)
- Schema: RIPPLE_SIGNAL.schema.md v1.0 compliant

### Actions Taken

1. **Analysis Phase**
   - Ran wake-up protocol (manual verification due to filename mismatch in script)
   - Used explore agent to understand delegation context in governance canon
   - Analyzed existing POLC framework (Section 4) and builder supervision model (Section 5)
   - Identified integration points with PLATFORM_AUTHORITY_BOUNDARY_AND_DELEGATION_MODEL.md and DELEGATION_INSTRUCTION_AND_AUDIT_MODEL.md

2. **Content Creation Phase**
   - Designed Section 5.5 structure (6 subsections)
   - Inserted new section between 5.4 (Builder Revocation) and Section 6 (Builder Self-Governance Prohibition)
   - Crafted content covering:
     - POLC-only constraint reinforcement
     - Work mode vs Evaluation mode distinction
     - Accountability chain preservation
     - Agent invocation protocol via task tool
     - Non-delegable responsibilities
     - Integration with existing delegation models
     - Future protocol reference (AGENT_INVOCATION_PROTOCOL.md Phase 2)

3. **Governance Alignment Phase**
   - Calculated SHA256 hash of updated FOREMAN_AUTHORITY_AND_SUPERVISION_MODEL.md
   - Updated CANON_INVENTORY.json with new hash (794010b4...)
   - Updated inventory metadata timestamp
   - Validated JSON syntax

4. **Auto-Ripple Preparation Phase**
   - Reviewed CONSUMER_REPO_REGISTRY.json (4 consumer repos identified)
   - Created ripple signal document following RIPPLE_SIGNAL.template.md
   - Classified as MEDIUM criticality, non-breaking, Plane 1 (proactive downward)
   - Documented consumer repo impact and reception instructions

5. **Quality Validation Phase**
   - Validated JSON files (CANON_INVENTORY.json, CONSUMER_REPO_REGISTRY.json)
   - Verified document structure (66 headers, consistent numbering)
   - Confirmed file size within governance limits
   - Ran code_review tool: ✓ No comments
   - Ran codeql_checker: ✓ Not applicable (documentation only)

6. **Evidence Creation Phase**
   - Created session memory (this file)
   - Rotated oldest session memory to archive (session-001-20260211.md)

### Decisions Made

**Decision 1: Section Placement (5.5 between 5.4 and Section 6)**
- **What**: Inserted delegation guidance as subsection 5.5 of Section 5 (Builder Appointment and Supervision Authority)
- **Why**: Logical bridge between builder supervision (5.1-5.4) and prohibition rules (Section 6). Maintains document flow and authority hierarchy.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Separate Section 6 (would push all subsequent sections forward), Appendix (would reduce visibility)
- **Authority**: Aligned with BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md section ordering principles

**Decision 2: Work Mode vs Evaluation Mode Distinction (5.5.1)**
- **What**: Explicit categorization of Foreman activities into "Work Mode" (delegation) vs "Evaluation Mode" (independent validation)
- **Why**: Clarifies when Foreman delegates vs when Foreman performs work directly (QA validation, architecture review). Prevents conflation of supervision with execution.
- **Supporting Evidence**: References to INDEPENDENT_ASSURANCE_EXECUTION_STRATEGY.md "evaluation mode" concept
- **Authority**: POLC model (Section 4) - Control function requires independent validation

**Decision 3: Guidance-Level (Phase 1) vs Full Protocol**
- **What**: Created guidance section rather than full protocol specification
- **Why**: Strategic Phase 1 approach minimizes disruption during MAT build. Full protocol (AGENT_INVOCATION_PROTOCOL.md) deferred to Phase 2 based on MAT learnings.
- **Rationale**: Issue description explicitly requested "guidance, not full protocol" for Phase 1
- **Future Path**: Section 5.5.6 references planned AGENT_INVOCATION_PROTOCOL.md

**Decision 4: Non-Breaking Classification**
- **What**: Classified change as non-breaking in ripple signal
- **Why**: Additive enhancement that clarifies existing practices. No modification to existing sections. Backward compatible with existing Foreman agent behaviors.
- **Validation**: No consumer repo action required; alignment occurs naturally during governance sync cycles

**Decision 5: MEDIUM Criticality Classification**
- **What**: Set ripple signal criticality to MEDIUM (not HIGH or LOW)
- **Why**: Affects Foreman agent interpretation but not breaking. Important for MAT Phase 1 but not emergency. Consumer repos should be aware but not blocked.
- **Authority**: RIPPLE_SIGNAL.schema.md guidance on criticality levels

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
1. **Strategic Use of Explore Agent**: Using explore agent to understand delegation context saved significant time and ensured comprehensive analysis of existing governance canon.
2. **Incremental Commits**: Three separate commits (initial plan, content addition, ripple signal) provided clear audit trail and recovery points.
3. **Cross-Reference Validation**: Explicit references to PLATFORM_AUTHORITY_BOUNDARY_AND_DELEGATION_MODEL.md and DELEGATION_INSTRUCTION_AND_AUDIT_MODEL.md strengthened authority chain.
4. **Template-Driven Ripple Signal**: Following RIPPLE_SIGNAL.template.md ensured schema compliance and comprehensive consumer notification.
5. **Work/Evaluation Mode Distinction**: Clear conceptual framework for when Foreman delegates vs validates directly.

### What Was Challenging
1. **Wake-Up Protocol Script**: Script expects `.agent.md` extension but file is just `.md`, requiring manual verification of CANON_INVENTORY and identity.
2. **File Size Management**: Initial concern about 36,995 char baseline + 166 lines addition, but stayed well within limits (43,271 chars final).
3. **Section Placement Decision**: Required careful analysis of document flow and authority hierarchy to determine optimal placement (5.5 vs separate section).
4. **POLC Integrity Balance**: Ensuring delegation guidance reinforced POLC model without contradicting existing non-delegable responsibilities (Section 8).
5. **Phase 1 vs Phase 2 Scope**: Distinguishing guidance-level content (Phase 1) from full protocol specification (Phase 2 future work).

### What Future Sessions Should Know
1. **Wake-Up Script Extension Issue**: The wake-up-protocol.sh expects `.agent.md` files, but CodexAdvisor-agent.md lacks this extension. Manual CANON_INVENTORY verification is sufficient workaround.
2. **Memory Rotation Protocol**: When 5 sessions exist, archive oldest to `.archive/` before creating new session. Keep only 5 most recent in `memory/`.
3. **Delegation Model Integration**: New Section 5.5 integrates with PLATFORM_AUTHORITY_BOUNDARY_AND_DELEGATION_MODEL.md (G-C12) and DELEGATION_INSTRUCTION_AND_AUDIT_MODEL.md (G-C13). Cross-reference when relevant.
4. **Ripple Signal Template**: RIPPLE_SIGNAL.template.md in governance/templates/ is comprehensive. Follow all sections for schema compliance.
5. **Consumer Repo Alignment**: Changes to PUBLIC_API layer_down_status canons trigger gradual alignment. Consumer repos will detect hash changes during next governance sync; no immediate action required unless breaking.
6. **Phase 2 Protocol Reference**: Future AGENT_INVOCATION_PROTOCOL.md will formalize task tool invocation patterns, multi-builder coordination, and cross-repo delegation. Section 5.5.6 provides placeholder for this future work.

### Governance Insights
1. **Delegation as Accountability Preservation**: Critical principle that delegation transfers execution authority but NEVER transfers accountability. Foreman remains accountable for builder selection, supervision, and validation.
2. **Work vs Evaluation Modes**: Explicit mode distinction prevents conflation of supervision (Foreman) with execution (Builder). Evaluation mode requires independent validation (QA rerun) by Foreman.
3. **POLC Integrity**: Non-delegable responsibilities (5.5.4) map directly to POLC phases (Planning, Organising, Leading, Control). Delegating these would violate Foreman's managerial authority.
4. **Ripple Plane Model**: Plane 1 (proactive downward) ripple is appropriate for governance canon enhancements. Plane 2 (reactive runtime) would apply to enforcement violations; Plane 3 (upward learning) to feedback loops.
5. **Guidance vs Protocol Distinction**: Phase 1 guidance-level content supports immediate MAT build execution without full protocol overhead. Phase 2 protocol formalization captures learnings from practice.
6. **Consumer Repo Autonomy**: Ripple signals are INFORMATIONAL ONLY. Consumer repos MAY acknowledge but are NOT required to act immediately. Silence is acceptable if signal not relevant.
