# Session 059 - 20260227 (Living Agent System v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: governance-repo-administrator
- Class: administrator
- Session ID: 059

## Task
End-to-end investigation of auto layering-down and ripple processes for the governance repository.
GitHub issue: "[Investigation] End-to-end auto layering-down and ripple process – governance repo"
Five structural gaps identified per CS2 review requirements.

## What I Did

### Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `governance/CONSUMER_REPO_REGISTRY.json` | v1.1.0 → v1.2.0: liaison fields populated (Gap 1) |
| `.github/workflows/governance-layer-down-dispatch.yml` | Added `repository_dispatch` step + header comment (Gap 2) |
| `governance/executable/workflows/consumer-alignment.yml.template` | `RIPPLE_DISPATCH_TOKEN` → `MATURION_BOT_TOKEN` (Gap 4) |
| `.github/layer-down-issue-template.md` | Auto-close eligibility section + auto-assign note |
| `governance/layer-down/LAYER_DOWN_INVESTIGATION_REPORT_20260227.md` | NEW — investigation report |
| `governance/CHANGELOG.md` | New entry `[LAYER-DOWN-INVESTIGATION-2026-02-27]` |
| `.agent-workspace/governance-repo-administrator/memory/.archive/session-055-20260224.md` | ARCHIVED (memory rotation) |
| `.agent-workspace/governance-repo-administrator/memory/session-059-20260227.md` | NEW — this file |

### Actions Taken
1. FAIL-ONLY-ONCE: self-attested against all Universal and Conditional rules — no violations
2. VERIFY: confirmed `governance-ripple-dispatch.yml` absent (legacy auto-PR discontinued)
3. VERIFY: identified all 5 structural gaps (see investigation report)
4. Gap 1 — populated `governance_liaison` in `CONSUMER_REPO_REGISTRY.json` for all 4 repos
5. Gap 2 — added `governance_ripple` `repository_dispatch` step to `governance-layer-down-dispatch.yml`
6. Gap 3 — confirmed layer-up workflows active and non-conflicting; both retained
7. Gap 4 — replaced `RIPPLE_DISPATCH_TOKEN` with `MATURION_BOT_TOKEN` in `consumer-alignment.yml.template`
8. Gap 5 — created investigation report, updated issue template, updated CHANGELOG
9. Memory: archived session-055 → active sessions = 5 (session-056, 057×2, 058, 059)

### Decisions Made
- All changes are within GA authority (operational registry, workflow, template updates)
- No CS2 approval required for this session's changes — no protected canon files touched, no agent files touched
- `repository_dispatch` step is non-blocking so issue creation (Signal 1) is never blocked by dispatch failures

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: `governance/layer-down/LAYER_DOWN_INVESTIGATION_REPORT_20260227.md`
- Canon hash validation: 187 entries, 0 failures (no CANON_INVENTORY changes this session)

### Ripple Status
- **Ripple required**: YES for `consumer-alignment.yml.template` fix — consumer repos that deployed this template need a backfill layer-down issue
- **Pending layer-downs identified**: 6 historical events requiring manual backfill (see report §6)

### Governance Gap Progress
- Gap 2 CLOSED: `repository_dispatch` (`governance_ripple`) now sent on every canonical push
- Gap 4 CLOSED: `consumer-alignment.yml.template` now uses `MATURION_BOT_TOKEN`
- Gap 1 CLOSED: all liaison fields populated in CONSUMER_REPO_REGISTRY.json
- Gap 3 RESOLVED: layer-up workflows confirmed active and non-conflicting
- Gap 5 DOCUMENTED: backfill plan in investigation report §6

### Governance Hygiene
- Memory rotation: session-055 archived → 5 active sessions (compliant with ≤5 rule)
- No protected canon files modified; no agent files modified (B-06 compliant)

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Five-gap framing from CS2 review made the investigation precise and actionable
- The `repository_dispatch` gap is invisible from the governance side — the consumer workflow exists but was permanently dormant

### What Was Challenging
- Undefined secrets in GitHub Actions fail silently (blank string) — `RIPPLE_DISPATCH_TOKEN` caused `align-governance` to fail quietly with no observable error
- Back-filling 6 historical layer-down events cannot be automated — requires manual issue creation per consumer repo

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- Every canonical push now sends two signals: issue (Signal 1) + `governance_ripple` dispatch (Signal 2)
- Consumer repos with `consumer-alignment.yml.template` deployed before 2026-02-27 need the token fix (Gap 4) via backfill layer-down issue
- 6 pending ripple plans need manual corrective dispatch — prioritise Session 058 canons (non-agent) first
- `RIPPLE-ECOSYSTEM-VOCAB-FOREMAN-MODALITIES-20260221.md` includes `foreman-v2.agent.md` — CS2 + CodexAdvisor required for that one

### Governance Insights
- A workflow that creates issues but sends no machine signal is only half a dispatch — always verify both signals are present
- Registry fields used by automation must be treated as required, not optional. Empty string = misconfiguration, not graceful degradation
