# Session 017 - 20260213 (Living Agent System v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: governance-repo-administrator
- Class: administrator
- Session ID: session-017-20260213

## Task
Create MANDATORY_CROSS_APP_COMPONENTS.md - a single, authoritative specification listing all mandatory components and patterns required in every Maturion app/repository. This includes watchdog agents, performance measurement, feedback mechanisms, AI chat interface dual pattern, compliance baseline, observability, startup requirements, and layer-down propagation rules.

## What I Did

### Files Modified (Auto-populated)
- Created: `governance/canon/MANDATORY_CROSS_APP_COMPONENTS.md` (SHA256: fc7270ff15c425af7227d703014e6831f6de69b34b9f0db55c44c2c519cfbb4f)
- Updated: `governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json` (added new canon entry at position 103, total canons: 154)
- Updated: `GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md` (added entry in alphabetical order)
- Archived: `session-014-20260211.md` to `.archive/` (memory rotation per protocol)

### Actions Taken
1. Executed wake-up protocol successfully - loaded identity, memories, governance state
2. Searched existing governance artifacts using search_code_subagent for relevant specifications
3. Reviewed key canonical documents:
   - ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETENESS_REQUIREMENTS.md
   - APP_STARTUP_REQUIREMENTS_DECLARATION.md
   - WATCHDOG_AUTHORITY_AND_SCOPE.md
   - COMPLIANCE_AND_STANDARDS_GOVERNANCE.md
   - EVIDENCE_ARTIFACT_BUNDLE_STANDARD.md
   - LEARNING_LOOP_CATEGORIES_AND_LIFECYCLE.md
   - MATURION_RUNTIME_EXECUTION_MONITOR_SPEC.md
4. Created comprehensive MANDATORY_CROSS_APP_COMPONENTS.md covering:
   - 8 mandatory component categories
   - Agent system & contracts
   - Watchdog & oversight
   - Performance measurement (AI/app/service)
   - Observability & telemetry
   - Feedback & learning mechanisms
   - Compliance & evidence baseline
   - Startup & commissioning
   - Architecture completeness
5. Included AI chat interface dual pattern (back office/front office)
6. Added layer-down propagation rules
7. Created audit checklist for new applications
8. Added crosswalk appendix mapping components to constitutional/canonical sources
9. Updated CANON_INVENTORY.json with proper SHA256 and metadata
10. Updated GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md with comprehensive description

### Decisions Made
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Included all component categories identified in the issue requirements plus additional mandatory components discovered during research
2. **Reference-Based Approach**: Linked to detailed specifications rather than duplicating content, following DRY principle
3. **Checklist Format**: Structured document with embedded checklists throughout for practical use in audits and initialization
4. **Dual Pattern Documentation**: Documented AI chat interface dual pattern (back office vs front office) based on evidence from Wave 5.1 Foreman Office implementation
5. **PUBLIC_API Status**: Classified as PUBLIC_API for layer-down to all consumer repositories
6. **Crosswalk Appendix**: Created comprehensive mapping back to source documents to ensure traceability and governance compliance

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: Session execution documented in this file
- Status: All required artifacts created and inventories updated
- Working contract: Generated during wake-up protocol
- Environment health: Validated clean working tree

### Ripple Status
- Status: Canon change requiring layer-down ripple
- Ripple required: YES
- Target: All consumer repositories (should reference MANDATORY_CROSS_APP_COMPONENTS.md for initialization and audits)
- Ripple log: Update required in governance/ripple/ripple-log.md
- Impact: New canon affects all new app initialization processes

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: Closed gap identified in issue - no single authoritative spec for mandatory components
- Gap addressed: Created master reference document eliminating rework and component gaps
- Governance hygiene: Proper SHA256 calculated, inventory entries updated

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: Clean - all changes committed and pushed
- Inventory integrity: CANON_INVENTORY.json updated with SHA256
- Memory rotation: Executed per protocol (archived oldest session)
- Working contract: Generated during wake-up

## Outcome
✅ **COMPLETE**

Successfully created comprehensive MANDATORY_CROSS_APP_COMPONENTS.md specification covering all requirements from the issue:
- ✅ Watchdog agent(s): coverage, scope, escalation requirements
- ✅ Performance measurement (AI, app, service): what must be present, how monitored
- ✅ Feedback mechanism: standards for learning/ripple/continuous improvement
- ✅ AI chat interface dual pattern (Backoffice vs. Front Office)
- ✅ Compliance baseline: required evidence folders/files, control traceability docs
- ✅ Generic observability/health checks/telemetry
- ✅ Required startup/commissioning/architecture completeness rules
- ✅ Layer-down propagation rules for updates to these components

Deliverables completed:
- ✅ MANDATORY_CROSS_APP_COMPONENTS.md created in canonical governance
- ✅ Links to detailed specs throughout (not duplicated)
- ✅ Checklist format for repo audits and new project bootstraps
- ✅ Crosswalk appendix linking spec areas back to constitutional/canonical docs
- ✅ Updated CANON_INVENTORY.json and GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
1. **Search-code-subagent effectiveness**: Using semantic search early was crucial to discovering all relevant governance documents quickly
2. **Parallel information gathering**: Viewing multiple documents simultaneously sped up research phase significantly
3. **Reference-based approach**: Linking to existing specs rather than duplicating kept document focused and maintainable
4. **Wake-up protocol**: Following the mandated wake-up sequence provided proper context and governance state

### What Was Challenging
1. **Comprehensive coverage**: Ensuring all mandatory components were captured without missing edge cases required extensive search and cross-referencing
2. **AI chat pattern documentation**: This pattern was derived from implementation evidence rather than explicit canonical guidance - had to synthesize from Wave 5.1 summary
3. **Appropriate detail level**: Balancing between providing enough detail for clarity vs. avoiding duplication of existing specs
4. **Memory rotation logic**: Initially had 6 session files, needed to properly archive to maintain ≤5 limit

### What Future Sessions Should Know
1. **Use this document as index**: MANDATORY_CROSS_APP_COMPONENTS.md now serves as master index for all mandatory components - reference it for new app initialization
2. **Layer-down ripple required**: This canon change affects all consumer repos - they should be updated to reference this document in their initialization processes
3. **Living document**: As new mandatory components are identified (e.g., through layer-up from application repos), this document should be updated
4. **Crosswalk maintenance**: The appendix mapping provides traceability - keep it updated when canonical sources change
5. **AI chat dual pattern**: This pattern is now explicitly documented for governance enforcement

### Governance Insights
1. **Gap closure**: This work addresses a strategic gap - previously no single source of truth for mandatory cross-app components
2. **Governance completeness**: Having this reference document enables better audits and reduces initialization gaps
3. **Layer-down clarity**: Explicit documentation of mandatory components makes layer-down propagation requirements clear
4. **Evidence-based synthesis**: Successfully synthesized patterns from implementation evidence (Wave 5.1) into governance requirements
5. **Constitutional integration**: Strong linkage back to constitutional canon (CONSTITUTION.md, BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md, etc.) maintains governance hierarchy
