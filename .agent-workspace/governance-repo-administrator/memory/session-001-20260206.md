# Session 001 - 20260206

## Task
Fix agent memory persistence - implement LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md requirements for persistent memory across sessions.

## What I Did
- Updated .gitignore to persist agent workspace while excluding ephemeral files
- Created .agent-workspace-template/ with complete structure
- Initialized workspaces for governance-repo-administrator and CodexAdvisor-agent
- Customized context files for both agents
- Committed all persistent memory structure to Git

## Ripple Status
N/A - No canon changes in this session

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE - Agent memory workspace is now persistent and compliant with LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md

## Lessons
- Memory persistence was broken by gitignoring entire .agent-workspace/ directory
- Only working-contract.md and environment-health.json should be ephemeral
- All memory, personal, context, and escalation files must persist for cross-session learning
- Wake-up and closure protocols depend on persistent memory structure
