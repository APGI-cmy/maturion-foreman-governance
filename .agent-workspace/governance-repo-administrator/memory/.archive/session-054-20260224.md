# Session 054 - 20260224 (Living Agent System v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: governance-repo-administrator

- Session ID: 20260224-160857

## Task
Apply three editorial/integrity patch corrections to `governance/canon/AGENT_HANDOVER_AUTOMATION.md` identified as post-v1.1.0 findings:
1. Header date not updated (cosmetic)
2. Silent PASS when validate-canon-hashes.sh is absent (governance integrity)
3. No consumer note for escaped backtick fence collision (usability)

## What I Did
### Files Modified (Auto-populated)
- `governance/canon/AGENT_HANDOVER_AUTOMATION.md`
  SHA256: 2f36cab8e8a0dbb7e3cd268690dfc4b602a14d9a5f65f334f7770772bcd5c019
- `governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json`
  (hash/version updated for AGENT_HANDOVER_AUTOMATION.md entry → v1.1.1)

### Actions Taken
- Action 1: Updated header `**Date**: 2026-02-17` → `**Date**: 2026-02-24` (Finding 1).
- Action 2: Replaced silent `ALIGNMENT_RESULT=0` skip in Section 4.3 governance/alignment block with an explicit `⚠️ SKIPPED` echo and confirmation prompt when `validate-canon-hashes.sh` is absent (Finding 2).
- Action 3: Added consumer note blockquote immediately after the `**Parity Check Protocol**:` heading warning agents about escaped backtick fences and how to copy the template correctly (Finding 3).
- Action 4: Bumped version header and footer to `1.1.1`.
- Action 5: Updated `CANON_INVENTORY.json` entry: new SHA256, version `1.1.1`, `effective_date: 2026-02-24`.

### Decisions Made
- Decision 1: The silent-PASS fix uses a self-contained if/else inside the script presence check — this avoids carrying a stale `ALIGNMENT_RESULT` variable into a separate if block, which was the original structural flaw.
- Decision 2: Version bumped to `1.1.1` (patch) per problem statement; no structural change warranting a minor bump.

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: this session memory file
- Status: COMPLETE

### Ripple Status
- Ripple required: YES — AGENT_HANDOVER_AUTOMATION.md is a canon document; consumer repos reference it. Layer-down ripple to be tracked by CS2.
- Status: Ripple tracking deferred to CS2 per governance protocol.

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: All three findings from the post-v1.1.0 review closed.

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: CANON_INVENTORY.json updated with correct hash and version. No placeholder hashes.

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

## Lessons
### What Worked Well
- Applying all three changes in a focused single pass before recomputing the hash prevents hash/content drift.

### What Was Challenging
- The nested markdown/bash fence structure makes it important to verify line numbers carefully before editing.

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- The consumer note (Finding 3) uses a blockquote (`>`) so it renders visually distinct inside the outer markdown fence — this is intentional.
- The silent-PASS fix is self-contained: SKIPPED does not add to GATE_FAILURES but produces visible output, preserving evidence-first behaviour without blocking agents in repos that legitimately have no validate-canon-hashes.sh.

### Governance Insights
- Evidence-first means even a skipped check must be declared, not silently passed. This principle should be audited across all other canon templates.
