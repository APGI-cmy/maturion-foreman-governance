# Session 058 - 20260226 (Living Agent System v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: governance-repo-administrator
- Class: administrator
- Session ID: 058

## Task
Implement the necessary governance canon changes to address the four canonical gaps in the testing system as described in the GitHub issue titled "[Governance Issue] Canonical Gaps in Testing System: Contract Testing, Coverage, Tooling, and Post-Production Validation".

## What I Did

### Files Created
- `governance/canon/CONTRACT_TESTING_CANON.md` (v1.0.0) — SHA256: `7452ab65959cfefde73065fe24eaa45111d7c515757e191ab498b0f1653a8ed0`
- `governance/canon/AUTOMATED_QUALITY_TOOLING_CANON.md` (v1.0.0) — SHA256: `c1f052a7dffaf1cf182c9d4aa6cc434ebd5e7a2a7cd1aa243fb6ed132f5fe9a5`
- `governance/canon/CODE_COVERAGE_THRESHOLD_CANON.md` (v1.0.0) — SHA256: `f969f80a18f3b8b628012232f40571639d7f8493fbedcdc68e003361a7dbed42`
- `governance/canon/POST_PRODUCTION_TELEMETRY_CANON.md` (v1.0.0) — SHA256: `f1c6b2c1df5620d7657b7a625434c7309c3ae0760c99f7f5e7f7671d4b23b85d`
- `.agent-admin/prehandover/proof-testing-canon-gaps-20260226.md`
- `.agent-workspace/governance-repo-administrator/memory/session-058-20260226.md` (this file)

### Files Modified
- `governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json` — 4 new entries added; total_canons 183→187; last_updated 2026-02-26
- `governance/CHANGELOG.md` — New entry `[TESTING-CANON-GAPS-2026-02-26]`
- `governance/GATE_REQUIREMENTS_INDEX.json` — 4 new enforcement gates added; last_updated 2026-02-26

### Session Memory Rotation
- Archived `session-053-20260224.md` → `.archive/`
- Archived `session-054-20260224.md` → `.archive/`
- Active sessions retained: 055, 056, 057 (×2), 058 = 5 sessions

### Actions Taken
1. **PREFLIGHT**: Read FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md; self-attested against all Universal and Conditional rules; no violations found
2. **INDUCTION**: Read COMBINED_TESTING_PATTERN.md, FINAL_COMPLETE_WAVE_TEST_PROTOCOL.md, CANON_INVENTORY.json, CHANGELOG.md, GATE_REQUIREMENTS_INDEX.json
3. **BUILD**: Created 4 new Tier-1 canonical governance standards
4. **BUILD**: Updated CANON_INVENTORY.json with 4 real SHA256 hashes (no placeholders)
5. **BUILD**: Updated CHANGELOG.md with versioned change entry
6. **BUILD**: Updated GATE_REQUIREMENTS_INDEX.json with 4 new enforcement gate definitions
7. **HANDOVER**: Created pre-handover proof; ran validate-canon-hashes.sh (0 failures / all 187 PASS); created session memory; rotated memory

### Decisions Made
- **Session 058** chosen as next session number (highest was 057, appeared twice)
- **Archived sessions 053 and 054** to bring active session count to 5 (055, 056, 057×2, 058) after adding 058
- **All 4 canon files set to PUBLIC_API layer_down_status** — these are consumer-facing standards requiring layer-down ripple to consumer repos
- **CHANGELOG entry notes migration required** — consumer repos need tooling updates; exception process documented in each canon
- **No existing canon files were modified** — all changes are additive; no CS2 approval for protected file changes required

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: `.agent-admin/prehandover/proof-testing-canon-gaps-20260226.md`
- CANON-HASH-001: `.github/scripts/validate-canon-hashes.sh` run — 0 failures — all 187 entries PASS
- Status: COMPLETE

### Ripple Status
- Status: PENDING — 4 new PUBLIC_API canon files created; layer-down ripple required to consumer repos
- Ripple required: YES (new PUBLIC_API canons; consumer repos must adopt tooling requirements)
- Note: Ripple dispatch to consumer repos should be initiated after PR merge per REQ-RA-001

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: 4 canonical testing gaps CLOSED:
  1. ✅ Missing API Contract Testing Canon → CONTRACT_TESTING_CANON.md
  2. ✅ Manual/Advisory-Only Tooling → AUTOMATED_QUALITY_TOOLING_CANON.md
  3. ✅ No Coverage Threshold Canon → CODE_COVERAGE_THRESHOLD_CANON.md
  4. ✅ No Post-Production Telemetry Canon → POST_PRODUCTION_TELEMETRY_CANON.md

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: CLEAN — no protected files modified; all hashes real; no placeholders; CHANGELOG updated; inventory updated

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- The existing canon file structure and CANON_INVENTORY schema were well-documented and easy to follow
- Python scripting for CANON_INVENTORY updates is reliable and avoids JSON editing errors
- validate-canon-hashes.sh immediately confirmed all 187 entries (including new 4) are valid
- The 4 canonical gap areas were well-described in the issue, enabling precise canon authorship

### What Was Challenging
- Session numbering was slightly ambiguous (two session-057 files existed); chose 058 as unambiguous next
- Memory rotation required archiving 2 sessions (not just 1) to accommodate new session + duplicate 057

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- Total canons is now 187 (was 183); next canon addition should increment to 188+
- CONTRACT_TESTING_CANON, AUTOMATED_QUALITY_TOOLING_CANON, CODE_COVERAGE_THRESHOLD_CANON, POST_PRODUCTION_TELEMETRY_CANON are all NEW as of 2026-02-26
- Layer-down ripple to consumer repos is still PENDING for these 4 new canons — should be dispatched after merge
- GATE_REQUIREMENTS_INDEX.json now has 6 enforcement gates (added 4 new ones this session)

### Governance Insights
- Canonical gaps in testing governance were structural: "100% GREEN" without coverage floor is insufficient
- The FCWT protocol referenced accessibility/performance validation but lacked binding thresholds — this session closes that gap
- Post-production telemetry is often the last governance layer to be defined; having it mandated before first production deployment prevents monitoring debt
