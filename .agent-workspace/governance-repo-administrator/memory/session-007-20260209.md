# Session 007 - 20260209 (Living Agent System v5.0.0)

## Task
Governance Task: Canonical Ripple Log Update + Bootstrap Memory + Layer-Up Protocol Improvement (PR #1054 & #1056)

## What I Did

### Part 1: Ripple Log Verification
- Verified canonical ripple log already contains NOTIFIED entries for PR #1054 and #1056
- Confirmed all three consumer repositories tracked:
  - maturion-foreman-office-app #705
  - PartPulse #238
  - R_Roster #89

### Part 2: CodexAdvisor Memory File
- Created `.agent-memory/` directory structure
- Created `RIPPLE_LOG_UPDATE_CHECKLIST.md` (5.4KB)
- Comprehensive checklist with 5 phases for ripple log maintenance
- Bootstrap backup to ensure CodexAdvisor never misses ripple updates

### Part 3: Layer-Up Protocol & Governance Improvements
**New Canonical Documents**:
1. **LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL.md** (22.7KB, v1.0.0, PUBLIC_API)
   - Explicit protocol for bidirectional governance evolution (apps → governance)
   - 8 layer-up triggers, 5-phase systematic process
   - Mandatory pre-canon-change layer-up scan
   - Drift detection and escalation workflows
   
2. **GOVERNANCE_ALIGNMENT_MONITORING_PROTOCOL.md** (21.6KB, v1.0.0, PUBLIC_API)
   - Systematic monitoring for governance alignment
   - 5-layer verification (version, SHA256, LOCKED, cross-refs, ripple)
   - Zero-drift target enforcement
   - Integration with agent wake-up protocols

**Updated Canonical Documents**:
3. **GOVERNANCE_RIPPLE_MODEL.md** (v1.0 → v1.0.1)
   - Added layer-up protocol integration
   - Enhanced bidirectional ripple tracking
   
4. **GOVERNANCE_RIPPLE_CHECKLIST_PROTOCOL.md** (v1.0.0 → v1.0.1)
   - Added STEP 0: Mandatory pre-canon-change layer-up scan
   - Drift detection before governance changes

**Inventory Updates**:
5. **GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md**
   - Added new section: Agent Memory Bootstrap
   - Added 3 new entries
   - Updated last_updated to 2026-02-09
   
6. **CANON_INVENTORY.json**
   - Added 2 new PUBLIC_API canon entries
   - Updated total_canons: 122 → 124

### Files Modified (Auto-populated)
  - No files modified

### Inventory Updates
- GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md: Updated with 3 new entries
- CANON_INVENTORY.json: Updated total_canons to 124

### Canon Changes
- Canon modified: Yes - 2 new canon files created, 2 updated
- New files: LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL.md, GOVERNANCE_ALIGNMENT_MONITORING_PROTOCOL.md
- Updated files: GOVERNANCE_RIPPLE_MODEL.md (v1.0.1), GOVERNANCE_RIPPLE_CHECKLIST_PROTOCOL.md (v1.0.1)

## Living Agent System v5.0.0 Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: .agent-workspace/governance-repo-administrator/evidence-20260209.log
- Status: 152 evidence entries collected

### Ripple Status
- Status: Last ripple: [2026-02-09 15:00] PR #1054 + #1056 Combined (7 files) → R_Roster (NOTIFIED) #89
- Ripple log verified for PR #1054 and #1056 entries
- No new ripple initiated (canon changes are governance meta-governance)

### Governance Gap Progress (Issue #1047)
- Status: Layer-Up Protocol and Governance Alignment Monitoring Protocol created (Issue #1047)
- Layer-Up Protocol closes bidirectional governance loop
- Governance Alignment Monitoring Protocol enables zero-drift enforcement

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: No hygiene issues detected during session
- All new documents follow canonical format and authority structure

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

All acceptance criteria met:
- [x] Ripple log verified for PR #1054/#1056 (NOTIFIED status confirmed)
- [x] CodexAdvisor memory checklist created in .agent-memory/
- [x] Layer-Up Protocol drafted and integrated
- [x] Governance Alignment Monitoring Protocol drafted
- [x] GOVERNANCE_RIPPLE_MODEL.md updated for bi-directional sync
- [x] GOVERNANCE_RIPPLE_CHECKLIST_PROTOCOL.md updated with layer-up STEP 0
- [x] Inventory files updated (both .md and .json)
- [x] Code review completed (no issues)
- [x] Security checks completed (no vulnerabilities)

## Lessons

**What Worked**:
- Wake-up protocol provided comprehensive environment validation
- Evidence collection throughout session maintained audit trail
- Parallel document creation (LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL + GOVERNANCE_ALIGNMENT_MONITORING_PROTOCOL) was efficient
- JSON inventory updates with jq worked smoothly after initial setup

**What Was Challenging**:
- Understanding the interplay between layer-up, layer-down, and ripple concepts required careful review of existing governance
- Ensuring new protocols align with existing governance framework required extensive cross-referencing
- Maintaining consistent format and authority structure across new documents

**What Future Sessions Should Know**:
- Layer-up protocol is now mandatory STEP 0 before any canon changes
- Pre-canon-change layer-up scan detects drift proactively
- Governance now has complete bidirectional evolution framework
- Zero-drift target is enforced with systematic monitoring
- CodexAdvisor has bootstrap backup checklist for ripple log maintenance
