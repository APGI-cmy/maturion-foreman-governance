# Session 053 - 20260224 (Living Agent System v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: governance-repo-administrator
- Class: administrator
- Session ID: 20260224-155110

## Task
Update `governance/canon/AGENT_HANDOVER_AUTOMATION.md` to enforce a pre-handover merge gate parity stop-and-fix protocol (issue: "Update AGENT_HANDOVER_AUTOMATION.md canon to enforce pre-handover merge gate parity stop & fix protocol").

## What I Did
### Files Modified (Auto-populated)
- `governance/canon/AGENT_HANDOVER_AUTOMATION.md`
  SHA256: 41ebe7661561c577b80f7a1a0fcdebfbe3c5e80a20d08e1d7139c6319ba3b5b9
- `governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json`
  (hash/version updated for AGENT_HANDOVER_AUTOMATION.md entry)

### Actions Taken
- Action 1: Added new Section 4.3 — Pre-Handover Merge Gate Parity Check (mandatory, BLOCKING) before the former Section 4.3 in `AGENT_HANDOVER_AUTOMATION.md`.
- Action 2: Renumbered former Section 4.3 (Compliance Check & Escalation) to Section 4.4.
- Action 3: Updated Phase 4 structure listing from three to four mandatory sections.
- Action 4: Updated Section 4.4 compliance failure response to require fixing ALL issues before proceeding; restricted escalation to genuinely ambiguous blockers.
- Action 5: Added new Anti-Patterns row: "Opening PR with failing gates" and "Escalating resolvable failures".
- Action 6: Updated Handover Validation Checklist to include the merge gate parity check item (BLOCKING).
- Action 7: Bumped version to 1.1.0 and updated Last Updated date.
- Action 8: Updated CANON_INVENTORY.json with new SHA256 hash, version 1.1.0, and effective_date 2026-02-24.

### Decisions Made
- Decision 1: Inserted Section 4.3 with a complete executable bash template covering all three standard merge gate checks (verdict, alignment, stop-and-fix) so agents have a concrete runnable script.
- Decision 2: Added a "Merge Gate Parity Rules" table for quick reference.
- Decision 3: Kept escalation document creation in Section 4.4 but narrowed the scope to ambiguous blockers only, adding explicit "do not escalate resolvable issues" language.

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: (this session memory file)
- Status: COMPLETE

### Ripple Status
- Ripple required: YES — AGENT_HANDOVER_AUTOMATION.md is a canon document; downstream consumer repos reference it. Layer-down ripple should be tracked.
- Status: Ripple issue to be raised by CS2 or next session as required.

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: Closed the governance gap identified in the issue: no mandatory local merge gate parity check before handover.

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: CANON_INVENTORY.json updated with new hash and version. No placeholder hashes introduced.

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

## Lessons
### What Worked Well
- Reading the full file before editing prevented numbering mistakes.
- Doing all edits in a single sequential pass avoided conflicts.

### What Was Challenging
- Ensuring the bash template within nested markdown code blocks is syntactically clear for agents consuming the canon.

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- The merge gate parity section (4.3) uses placeholder `<verdict check commands>` that each agent contract must fill in with repo-specific commands; this is intentional since the canon is a template.
- CANON_INVENTORY.json last_updated field was also updated to 2026-02-24.

### Governance Insights
- Opening a PR with failing gates is now explicitly prohibited at the same severity level as pushing to main. This closes the ambiguity that was causing recurring compliance failures.
