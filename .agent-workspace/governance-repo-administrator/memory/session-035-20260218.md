# Session 035 - 20260218 (Living Agent System v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: governance-repo-administrator
- Class: administrator
- Session ID: copilot/add-infra-and-frontend-validations

## Task
Institutionalize lessons learned from MAT Waves 5-7 into global governance and architecture processes regarding infrastructure deployment, UI wiring, frontend scaffolding, and checklist/canon completeness.

**Issue**: [Governance/Architecture Retro] Institutionalize Infra, Wiring, and Frontend Validation – Cross-wave Lessons Layered (Waves 5–7, MAT)

**Context**: Multiple recurring oversights across MAT waves:
- Wave 5.5: Missed React app scaffolding/wiring
- Wave 5.6: Missed UI wiring/tests
- Wave 5.7: Missed backend (Supabase) deployment

## What I Did

### Files Created
1. **`governance/canon/WAVES_5_TO_7_INFRA_FE_WIRING_LESSONS.md`** (22KB, v1.0.0, PUBLIC_API)
   - SHA256: 503d2a4d8d0ebdc8f44e4d1efa7dea82bce7229a2c5680a018bb7242b61025ff
   - Comprehensive canon documenting failure patterns from Waves 5.5, 5.6, 5.7
   - 13 sections covering failure analysis, prevention measures, enforcement mechanisms
   - Integration with FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md and BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md
   - Cross-references to deviation chain (#9, #12, #13)
   - Success metrics and failure indicators
   - Quick reference checklist appendix

### Files Modified
2. **`governance/templates/minimum-architecture-template.md`**
   - Added Section 4.1.1: Infrastructure Deployment Validation (pre-wave checklist)
   - Added Section 4.11.1: Frontend-Backend Wiring (UI scaffolding, API integration, deployment)
   - Added Section 4.12.1: Mandatory Workflow Evidence (working URLs, E2E tests, evidence structure)
   - Added explicit prohibitions against wave closure without deployments

3. **`governance/templates/BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER_TEMPLATE.md`**
   - Added Section 5.1: Critical Deliverable Validation
   - Frontend application deliverables checklist
   - Backend application deliverables checklist
   - UI-to-Backend wiring validation requirements
   - Infrastructure deployment evidence requirements
   - Prohibition list for wave closure

4. **`governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json`**
   - Added WAVES_5_TO_7_INFRA_FE_WIRING_LESSONS.md entry
   - Updated total_canons: 167 → 168
   - Updated last_updated timestamp to 2026-02-18

5. **`governance/CHANGELOG.md`**
   - Added comprehensive entry: [WAVES-5-7-LESSONS-INSTITUTIONALIZATION]
   - Documented all affected artifacts
   - Provided migration guidance for consumer repositories
   - Cross-referenced related canon and deviations

6. **`GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md`**
   - Added WAVES_5_TO_7 canon entry after FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD
   - Categorized as: Readiness, Layer-down, PR-gates, Feedback/learning

### Actions Taken
1. **Discovery & Analysis**:
   - Reviewed issue requirements and acceptance criteria
   - Examined existing templates (architecture, build progress tracker, post-mortem)
   - Reviewed Wave 5 and 5.1 summaries
   - Found BL-031 (Wave 5.5 agent discovery failure) in Bootstrap Learnings
   - Searched for deviation documentation (#9, #12, #13)

2. **Canon Creation**:
   - Documented cross-wave failure patterns
   - Identified 4 systemic failure patterns:
     * Missing deliverable detection failure
     * "Tests pass" ≠ "System works" conflation
     * Deployment deferred to "later"
     * Architecture completeness not enforced
   - Defined prevention measures across 3 governance layers
   - Created enforcement mechanisms (pre-wave gate, closure gate, CI/CD)

3. **Template Strengthening**:
   - Enhanced architecture template with 3 new mandatory sections
   - Added explicit infrastructure deployment validation
   - Added frontend-backend wiring requirements
   - Added mandatory workflow evidence checklist
   - Enhanced build progress tracker with deliverable validation

4. **Governance Documentation**:
   - Updated CANON_INVENTORY with full SHA256 hash
   - Created comprehensive CHANGELOG entry with migration guidance
   - Updated GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY with canon description
   - Ensured cross-references to related canon

### Decisions Made

**Decision 1**: Create standalone canon vs. update existing canon
- **Choice**: Created new WAVES_5_TO_7_INFRA_FE_WIRING_LESSONS.md
- **Rationale**: Cross-wave pattern analysis deserves dedicated canon document
- **Why**: Easier to reference, ripple, and maintain; complements FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md

**Decision 2**: Update architecture template vs. create separate checklist
- **Choice**: Updated minimum-architecture-template.md with new sections
- **Rationale**: Sections 4.1.1, 4.11.1, 4.12.1 are core architecture completeness requirements
- **Why**: Ensures all future architectures include infrastructure/wiring/evidence from day one

**Decision 3**: Placement of deliverable validation in build tracker
- **Choice**: Added as Section 5.1 within Stage 5 (Build Execution & Evidence)
- **Rationale**: Stage 5 is where deliverables are created and verified
- **Why**: Natural checkpoint for physical deliverable validation before wave closure

**Decision 4**: Level of detail in failure pattern documentation
- **Choice**: Detailed per-wave analysis + systemic pattern synthesis
- **Rationale**: Need both specific examples and generalizable patterns
- **Why**: Specific examples provide evidence; patterns enable prevention across future waves

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: PR commits documenting all changes
- Status: Complete - all artifacts created/updated successfully

### Ripple Status
- Status: Ripple required (PUBLIC_API canon)
- Ripple required: YES
- Consumer repositories: maturion-isms, maturion-foreman-office-app, PartPulse, future MAT repos
- Agent contracts requiring updates: foreman-v2, ui-builder, api-builder

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: Major governance gap addressed
- Gap: Wave closure gates validated test pass rates but NOT deliverable existence/deployment
- Solution: Institutionalized prevention measures across templates, canon, and enforcement mechanisms

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: Excellent
- CANON_INVENTORY updated with full SHA256
- CHANGELOG comprehensive with migration guidance
- Cross-references complete
- No governance debt created

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

All acceptance criteria met:
- [x] Architecture checklist/canon updated and cross-linked
- [x] Governance/post-mortem docs layered
- [x] Preventive checks for FE/BE infra/wiring baked into build cycle globally
- [x] Templates/examples updated as required
- [x] Deviation chain (#9, #12, #13) documented, lessons canonized

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
1. **Comprehensive failure pattern analysis** - Examining Waves 5.5, 5.6, 5.7 together revealed systemic patterns vs. isolated incidents
2. **Template-embedded prevention** - Adding validation sections directly to architecture template ensures proactive enforcement
3. **Integration with existing canon** - Cross-referencing FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md and BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md strengthens governance coherence
4. **Evidence-first documentation** - Concrete examples from real waves make lessons tangible and actionable

### What Was Challenging
1. **Finding deviation documentation** - Issues #9, #12, #13 weren't clearly marked as deviations; had to search across multiple sources
2. **Balancing detail vs. usability** - Canon is 22KB; ensured appendix provides quick reference checklist for practitioners
3. **Determining scope boundaries** - Decided against updating POST_MORTEM_GAP_ANALYSIS template in this session to maintain focus

### What Future Sessions Should Know
1. **Ripple execution needed** - This PUBLIC_API canon requires layer-down ripple to all consumer repositories
2. **Agent contract updates pending** - foreman-v2, ui-builder, api-builder need updates per Section 6 of canon
3. **Template adoption monitoring** - Track whether future architectures actually use new sections 4.1.1, 4.11.1, 4.12.1
4. **Effectiveness metrics** - Monitor whether wave closures now enforce deployment/wiring validation (success metrics in Section 7)

### Governance Insights
1. **Reactive vs. Proactive Governance** - This work is reactive (fixing after failures). Section 12 of canon notes ideal is proactive (architecture approval prevents wave start without complete specs)
2. **Test Coverage Illusion** - High test pass rates provided false confidence in completeness. Governance must validate deliverable existence, not just test results
3. **"Tests Pass" ≠ "Deployed" ≠ "Working"** - Critical rule now institutionalized across templates and canon
4. **Architecture Completeness Enforcement Gap** - Architecture specified components but implementation plans didn't enforce delivery. Templates now require explicit traceability
