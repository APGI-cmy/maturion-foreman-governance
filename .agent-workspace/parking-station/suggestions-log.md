# Suggestions Log

Agent suggestions for governance promotion. Reviewed periodically by CS2.

| Date | Agent | Session | Suggestion | Evidence |
|------|-------|---------|------------|----------|
| 2026-02-23 | governance-repo-administrator | session-047 | CANON-HASH-001: Add mandatory file_hash length validation (==64 chars) to PREHANDOVER checklist and agent contract to prevent truncated hash recurrence | session-047-20260223.md |
| 2026-02-23 | governance-repo-administrator | session-048 | RCA-HASH-TRUNC-001 REMEDIATED: All 177 truncated file_hash entries in CANON_INVENTORY.json corrected to full 64-char SHA256 (CS2 authorized). Validation script `.github/scripts/validate-canon-hashes.sh` committed (CANON-HASH-001 gate). AIMC_CANONIZATION_COMPLETE.md relocated from repo root to agent workspace. See RCA-HASH-TRUNC-001-addendum-20260223.md. | session-048-20260223.md |
| 2026-02-23 | governance-repo-administrator | session-049 | CANON-HASH-001 gate promoted to agent contract: Added CANON-HASH-001 checklist entry to Phase 4.1 Evidence block and Execution Checklist in `governance-repo-administrator-v2.agent.md` (CS2-authorized Issue #1189, references PR #1186). Gate now fully closed: validation script committed (session-048) + contract updated (session-049). | session-049-20260223.md |
| 2026-02-27 | governance-repo-administrator | session-059 | ADMINISTRATOR-CHECKLIST-GAP: An ADMINISTRATOR_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md does not exist in `governance/checklists/` — only builder, foreman, liaison, orchestrator, specialist, and platform-AI checklists exist. Creating an administrator-specific checklist would provide clearer guidance for administrator agent alignment audits. | session-059-20260227.md |
