# Memory Directory

This directory stores rolling session memories as per LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md canon.

## Structure

- Last 5 session memories kept here as `session-NNN-YYYYMMDD.md`
- Older sessions archived to `.archive/sessions-YYYY-MM/`
- Monthly summaries in `.archive/summary-YYYY-MM.md`

## Session Memory Format

Each session memory file should contain:
- Task description
- Actions taken
- Decisions made and rationale
- Patterns discovered
- Mistakes avoided
- Efficiency improvements
- Blockers encountered
- Governance gaps identified
- Outcome status

## Memory Rotation

When more than 5 session files exist:
1. Move oldest sessions to `.archive/sessions-YYYY-MM/`
2. Update monthly summary with key learnings
3. Maintain continuity through summaries

## Governance

This memory structure is **MANDATORY** per LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md and must never be gitignored.
