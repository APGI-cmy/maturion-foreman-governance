## Active Mandates

### Constitutional Principles (BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md)
1. Architecture → QA → Build → Validation
2. Zero Test Debt: 100% passage, no suppression
3. 100% Handovers: Complete or escalate
4. Warnings = Errors
5. CI Confirmatory: Local validation first
6. Gate Alignment: Verify script/CI match before handover
