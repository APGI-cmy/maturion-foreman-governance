# Session 001 - 20260226 — IAA Self-Improvement Session (Living Agent System v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: governance-repo-administrator (acting on behalf of IAA self-improvement initiative)
- Class: administrator
- Session ID: GA-20260226-IAA-BOOTSTRAP
- Canon version loaded: INDEPENDENT_ASSURANCE_AGENT_CANON.md v1.0.0

## Task
Implement [IAA Self-Improvement] Issue: Codify recurring build shortfalls & learning loop as Tier-2 checklist, overlay, and FAIL-ONLY-ONCE memory update.

Specifically:
1. Review recent assurance sessions and build QA notes to identify recurring shortfalls
2. Codify each shortfall as Tier-2 invariant, overlay, or FAIL-ONLY-ONCE entry
3. Update session memory template to enforce mandatory learning loop
4. Evaluate governance layer-down (Tier-3 canon proposals)
5. Create the IAA workspace structure (it did not previously exist)

### Recurring Shortfalls Identified and Codified

From review of governance session memories (sessions 053–057), CodexAdvisor sessions (002–006), and the IAA canon:

| Shortfall | Codified In |
|-----------|------------|
| Missing merge gate parity check at handover | INV-405 (BLOCKING), B-12 FAIL-ONLY-ONCE |
| Blank or generic session memory lessons | INV-602, B-07 FAIL-ONLY-ONCE |
| Ripple assessment absent from governance PRs | OVA-005, OVA-006, INV-207 |
| Inline improvement suggestions (POLC violation) | A-09 FAIL-ONLY-ONCE, INV-404 |
| Wave/issue traceability gaps in working proofs | INV-306, INV-701–704, OVC-001 |
| Draft PR submitted for assurance | INV-409 |
| Session memory FAIL-ONLY-ONCE attestation not recorded | OVE-003 |
| Agent integrity check skipped when no agent files in diff | INV-504 |
| Layer-up scan absent before canon changes | OVA-007 (REQ-RA-005) |
| Boilerplate proof artifacts (substance over form) | A-08 FAIL-ONLY-ONCE, INV-302, INV-303 |
| Open stop-and-fix blockers at handover | INV-406 |
| CHANGELOG update silently skipped for governance PRs | INV-408, OVA-003 |
| Constraints section omitted from preflight proofs | INV-106 |
| Ripple log not created despite YES ripple assessment | OVA-006 (REQ-RA-003) |
| Recurring shortfalls observed but not formally promoted | B-08 FAIL-ONLY-ONCE, OVF-002, INV-603 |

### Decisions Made

- **Decision 1: Create IAA workspace from scratch** — The `.agent-workspace/independent-assurance-agent/` directory did not exist. Rather than wait for a separate bootstrapping session, the workspace was created in this session as the IAA self-improvement work mandates these files exist.

- **Decision 2: Version Tier-2 artifacts as v1.1.0** — The IAA canon and bootstrap token (session CS2-BOOTSTRAP-001 for PR #1200) represent v1.0.0 seeding. This self-improvement session adds recurring shortfall codification as v1.1.0, clearly marking the evolution.

- **Decision 3: 10 Universal + 12 Conditional FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rules** — More comprehensive than other agents' 8+5 rules because the IAA role as final assurance gate requires explicit rules for every known failure mode, including learning loop enforcement and substance-over-form evaluation.

- **Decision 4: Overlay F (Learning Loop) as a standalone overlay** — The learning loop is a distinct operational category that applies at every session close, not just for specific PR types. Making it a named overlay ensures it appears in every assurance invocation artifact.

- **Decision 5: Session memory template enforced as MANDATORY** — The v1.1.0 template now labels the Learning Loop section as MANDATORY with an explicit governance violation warning, implementing INV-601 to INV-605.

- **Decision 6: Governance layer-down evaluation** — Several identified shortfalls are already addressed at Tier-3 via existing canon (POLC violations → MERGE_GATE_PHILOSOPHY.md, merge gate parity → AGENT_HANDOVER_AUTOMATION.md §4.3). The Tier-2 additions in this session reference these Tier-3 anchors rather than duplicating them. No new Tier-3 canon changes are proposed at this time; if recurring shortfalls are observed 3+ times across live IAA sessions, the Overlay F table will track escalation to CS2.

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: This session memory
- Status: COMPLETE

### FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Attestation
- Pre-session: ✅ Self-attested against GA FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md (all Universal Rules A-01 to A-08, applicable Conditional Rules B-01 to B-06) — no violations
- Protected file changes: NONE (this PR only creates new files in .agent-workspace/)
- Direct main push: NO — PR-only write

### Ripple Status
- Ripple required: NO — this PR creates new Tier-2 knowledge files in the IAA workspace. No Tier-3 canon files modified. No ripple required.
- Consumer repos: Not affected by Tier-2 agent workspace changes in governance repo.

### Governance Gap Progress
- Gap closed: IAA workspace was missing entirely; now bootstrapped with Tier-2 knowledge
- Gap closed: Recurring shortfalls had no formal Tier-2 representation; now codified
- Gap closed: IAA session memory template lacked mandatory learning loop section; now enforced

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: No CANON_INVENTORY.json changes (Tier-2 files not tracked in CANON_INVENTORY); no protected files modified; no placeholder hashes introduced

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE — All IAA Tier-2 knowledge files created. Recurring shortfalls codified. Learning loop enforced in session memory template.

## 🔄 LEARNING LOOP (MANDATORY)

### Improvement Suggestions for This Session
1. The IAA agent contract file (`.github/agents/independent-assurance-agent.md`) should be created or verified to exist — without it, the IAA cannot operate as a formal agent. Future session: verify or create IAA agent contract with CS2 approval.
2. The `governance/quality/agent-integrity/INTEGRITY_INDEX.md` does not currently contain an IAA agent contract entry. Once the IAA agent contract is created, CS2 should add its baseline hash to INTEGRITY_INDEX.md.
3. Consider whether `iaa-core-invariants-checklist.md` and `iaa-category-overlays.md` should be tracked in `governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json` as Tier-2 reference artifacts — currently only Tier-1 canon files are tracked, but high-value Tier-2 files might benefit from hash integrity tracking.

### Recurring Shortfalls to Promote
- All 15 recurring shortfalls identified in this session are being codified for the first time (bootstrap session) — no prior session comparisons available.
- Future sessions: use the Overlay F self-improvement feedback table to track recurrence counts.

### Prior Session Improvements Review
- N/A — this is the first IAA workspace session. No prior improvement suggestions to review.

### Tier-2 Updates Triggered by This Session
- ✅ All new invariants and overlays created in this session (INV-106, INV-206, INV-207, INV-306, INV-307, INV-405–409, INV-504, INV-601–605, INV-701–704, OVA-006, OVA-007, OVB-007, OVC-006–008, OVE-003–004, Overlay F)
- Next session: No further updates triggered; monitor Overlay F recurrence table for escalation candidates

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Reviewing GA session memories (053–057) and CodexAdvisor sessions surfaced concrete, real-world shortfalls rather than theoretical gaps
- The 3-tier architecture and existing FAIL-ONLY-ONCE patterns from other agents provided a solid template to work from

### What Was Challenging
- The IAA workspace did not exist — determining the right scope for a bootstrap vs. incremental update required careful judgment
- Balancing comprehensiveness (all known gaps) with actionability (checks must be performable by a real agent)

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- The IAA agent contract file (`.github/agents/independent-assurance-agent.md`) may or may not exist — verify before the first live assurance session
- INTEGRITY_INDEX.md should be updated with IAA agent contract baseline once the file is confirmed
- The Overlay F self-improvement feedback table starts with seed entries from this session; update it as real assurance sessions are run

### Governance Insights
- The absence of a formal IAA Tier-2 workspace was itself a governance gap — the IAA canon mandated Tier-2 knowledge but the workspace was never created at bootstrap
- Codifying recurring shortfalls works best when anchored to specific, evidenced session observations rather than theoretical concerns
