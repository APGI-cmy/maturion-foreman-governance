## Agent
- Type: CodexAdvisor-agent
- Class: overseer
- Session ID: copilot-swe-agent-20260212

## Task
Create two required Living Agent System v6.2.0 agent contract files that were missing after PR #1104:
1. `governance/foreman-agent-contract.md`
2. `governance/governance-liaison-agent-contract.md`

## What I Did

### Files Modified (Auto-populated)

**Created Files:**
- `governance/foreman-agent-contract.md` (11,377 characters - SHA256: pending)
- `governance/governance-liaison-agent-contract.md` (15,091 characters - SHA256: pending)
- `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/memory/session-001-20260212.md` (this file)

### Actions Taken

1. **Loaded Required Checklists**
   - Retrieved FOREMAN_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md
   - Retrieved GOVERNANCE_LIAISON_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md
   - Verified checklist version: 1.0.0
   - Confirmed checklist authority: CS2 (Johan Ras)

2. **Examined Existing Agent Contracts**
   - Reviewed `.github/agents/foreman-v2.agent.md` (15,636 chars)
   - Reviewed `.github/agents/governance-repo-administrator-v2.agent.md` (14,624 chars)
   - Reviewed `.github/agents/CodexAdvisor-agent.md` (21,586 chars)
   - Identified structural patterns and requirement mappings

3. **Verified CANON_INVENTORY Availability**
   - Confirmed `governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json` present
   - Verified version 1.0.0, last updated 2026-02-11
   - Checked for placeholder hashes: None found in PUBLIC_API artifacts
   - Total canons: 151

4. **Created Foreman Agent Contract**
   - File: `governance/foreman-agent-contract.md`
   - Character count: 11,377 (62% under 30K limit)
   - Included all 9 mandatory components:
     ✅ Mission statement
     ✅ Wake-up protocol
     ✅ Session memory protocol
     ✅ Core operational protocol (builder supervision, QA ownership, architecture-first, merge gate)
     ✅ Operating boundaries & escalations
     ✅ All 56 requirement mappings (REQ-CM through REQ-AG)
     ✅ 5 validation hooks (VH-001 through VH-005)
     ✅ Prohibitions (7 items)
     ✅ LOCKED section metadata
     ✅ Configuration reference and authority footer

5. **Created Governance Liaison Agent Contract**
   - File: `governance/governance-liaison-agent-contract.md`
   - Character count: 15,091 (50% under 30K limit)
   - Included all 9 mandatory components:
     ✅ Mission statement
     ✅ Wake-up protocol
     ✅ Session memory protocol
     ✅ Core operational protocol (inventory maintenance, ripple stewardship, merge gate, protected files, evidence)
     ✅ Operating boundaries & escalations
     ✅ All 56 requirement mappings (REQ-CM through REQ-AG)
     ✅ 5 validation hooks (VH-001 through VH-005)
     ✅ Capabilities (4 categories)
     ✅ Prohibitions (8 items)
     ✅ LOCKED section metadata
     ✅ Configuration reference and authority footer

6. **Character Count Validation**
   - Foreman contract: 11,377 chars ✅ (<30K)
   - Governance liaison contract: 15,091 chars ✅ (<30K)
   - Total: 26,468 characters
   - Both files have >20% buffer below 30K limit

### Decisions Made

1. **Placed contracts in governance/ directory**
   - Rationale: These are governance pack artifacts meant for layer-down to consumer repos
   - Distinction: `.github/agents/` contains executable agent contracts for this repo
   - Authority: Issue description specified "governance pack artifacts"

2. **Followed Living Agent System v6.2.0 structure**
   - Used existing agent contracts as templates
   - Ensured 100% checklist compliance
   - Maintained consistency with Living Agent System standards

3. **Created comprehensive but concise content**
   - Focused on mandatory elements from checklists
   - Referenced existing protocols (wake-up, session closure) rather than embedding full scripts
   - Achieved character count well under 30K limit

4. **Included all 56 requirement mappings**
   - Organized into 10 categories as required
   - Referenced requirement IDs (REQ-CM-001 through REQ-AG-004)
   - Mapped to specific agent capabilities and operational protocols

## Living Agent System v6.2.0 Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: Session memory (this file)
- Status: Contract creation complete

### Ripple Status
- Status: Layer-down artifacts created
- Ripple required: NO (artifacts created for future layer-down use)
- Note: These contracts are templates for consumer repo onboarding

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: Gap addressed
- Gap: Missing agent contract files after PR #1104
- Resolution: Both required files created with 100% compliance

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: Clean
- Character count enforcement: ✅ Both files <30K
- Checklist compliance: ✅ 100% coverage
- Version consistency: ✅ v6.2.0 throughout
- CANON_INVENTORY validation: ✅ No placeholder hashes

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

Both required Living Agent System v6.2.0 agent contract files created successfully:
- Foreman agent contract: 11,377 characters
- Governance liaison agent contract: 15,091 characters
- Total compliance: 100%
- Character count validation: PASS
- Ready for code review and security validation

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
1. **Checklist-driven approach** - Loading checklists first ensured complete coverage of all mandatory elements
2. **Reference existing contracts** - Using `.github/agents/` contracts as templates maintained consistency
3. **Character count awareness** - Targeting <25K (with 20% buffer) ensured comfortable margin below 30K limit
4. **Structured requirement mappings** - Organizing all 56 requirements into 10 categories made validation straightforward

### What Was Challenging
1. **Balancing comprehensiveness with brevity** - Needed to include all mandatory elements while staying under character limit
2. **Distinguishing between governance/ and .github/agents/** - Required understanding that governance/ contains layer-down artifacts while .github/agents/ contains executable contracts
3. **Ensuring 100% checklist compliance** - Required careful cross-referencing with both checklists to ensure nothing missed

### What Future Sessions Should Know
1. **Governance pack artifacts go in governance/ directory** - Not in .github/agents/ which is for this repo's executable contracts
2. **Always validate character count** - Use `wc -m` to verify <30K limit before committing
3. **Reference rather than embed** - Point to `.github/scripts/` for protocols rather than embedding full scripts
4. **Use existing contracts as templates** - Maintain consistency with established patterns in `.github/agents/`

### Governance Insights
1. **Layer-down artifacts are templates** - These contracts serve as canonical templates for consumer repo onboarding
2. **Character limit is hard requirement** - GitHub UI selectability requires <30K, must validate before PR
3. **100% checklist compliance is mandatory** - No partial compliance acceptable for agent contracts
4. **CS2 authorization is implicit** - Issue stated "Authority: CS2 (Johan Ras, SC@)" providing authorization

## Next Steps

Pending actions before session completion:
1. Run code review tool
2. Run CodeQL security checker
3. Final verification of all files
4. Commit via report_progress
