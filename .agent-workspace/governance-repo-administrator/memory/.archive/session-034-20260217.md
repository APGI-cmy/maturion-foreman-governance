   - Documented migration requirements, rationale, impact, and integration points

### Actions Taken

1. **Phase 1: Repository Exploration**
   - Reviewed FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md (v1.0.0)
   - Reviewed WAVE_MODEL.md (v1.0.0)
   - Identified governance structure and template patterns
   - Confirmed canonical integration points

2. **Phase 2: FCWT Protocol Creation**
   - Defined FCWT purpose and constitutional authority
   - Established 10-step comprehensive validation protocol:
     1. Pre-FCWT Validation (FM responsibility)
     2. QA-to-Red Suite Compilation and Execution (100% GREEN)
     3. Seed Data Population (50+ audits, 100+ criteria, 200+ evidence)
     4. Major Use-Case Flow Testing (all workflows)
     5. Edge/Corner/Error Case Testing (empty states, boundaries, errors, large data)
     6. UX/Workflow/Accessibility Testing (mobile-first, responsive, performant)
     7. Adversarial/Stress Testing (security, boundary exploitation, workflow violations)
     8. Documentation and Evidence Compilation (video, screenshots, logs, data tables)
     9. FCWT Summary Report and Handover (consolidate all results)
     10. FM Validation and Certification (issue certification)
   - Defined FCWT executor authority (UI Builder or QA agent)
   - Defined FM supervision protocol
   - Defined test debt policy for FCWT-specific tests
   - Defined FM/owner input protocol with blocking authority
   - Defined evidence chain requirements (.fcwt-evidence/ structure)
   - Integrated with FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md (3 definitions)
   - Integrated with WAVE_MODEL.md (wave closure requirements)
   - Established FCWT as formal closure checkpoint

3. **Phase 3: Template Creation**
   - Created comprehensive FCWT execution checklist (18KB)
   - Created formal handover contract template (16KB)
   - Created FCWT summary report template (16KB)
   - All templates align with protocol structure and requirements

4. **Phase 4: Inventory Updates**
   - Added FCWT protocol to CANON_INVENTORY.json with full SHA256 hash
   - Updated GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md with protocol and templates
   - Updated governance/CHANGELOG.md with detailed entry including migration guidance

### Decisions Made

1. **FCWT as Tier-1 PUBLIC_API Canon**
   - Decision: Make FCWT a Tier-1 (not Tier-0) standard
   - Rationale: Constitutional canons (Tier-0) are foundational; FCWT is operationalization of existing Tier-0 standards (FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md, WAVE_MODEL.md)
   - Layer-down status: PUBLIC_API (mandatory ripple to all consumer repos)

2. **10-Step Protocol Structure**
   - Decision: Define comprehensive 10-step protocol vs. simpler checklist
   - Rationale: FCWT must be thorough and evidence-based, not a formality; detailed steps ensure completeness and repeatability
   - Trade-off: More detailed = more work, but prevents gaps and ensures quality

3. **FCWT Executor Authority**
   - Decision: UI Builder or QA agent (per FM assignment), not always FM
   - Rationale: Leverage specialized testing expertise; FM supervises but delegates execution
   - FM retains: Validation, certification, and blocking authority

4. **Test Debt Policy**
   - Decision: Allow FCWT-specific test creation with post-sign-off clearing
   - Rationale: Enable comprehensive testing without blocking on missing tests; FM decides integration vs. archival
   - Governance: Document all FCWT-created tests, clear debt after sign-off

5. **Evidence Structure**
   - Decision: Standardized `.fcwt-evidence/` directory with defined subdirectories
   - Rationale: Consistent evidence organization for audit compliance; easy discovery and access
   - Structure: test-results/, seed-data/, functional-tests/, ux-tests/, media/, summary reports

6. **Handover Contract Format**
   - Decision: Formal contract validating 3 "fully functional" definitions with sign-off section
   - Rationale: Evidence-based contract provides audit trail and formal closure; validates against governance standards
   - Sign-off: Executor → FM → CS2 progression

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: Git commit 2e0e821 "Add FCWT governance protocol and templates"
- Status: 7 files changed, 2,483 insertions, 10 deletions
- Files: 4 created, 3 modified
- All files committed and pushed to copilot/define-fcwt-governance-process branch

### Ripple Status
- Status: Not yet executed (awaiting CS2 approval)
- Ripple required: YES (PUBLIC_API canon and templates)
- Target repositories: All consumer repos with application development (maturion-isms, maturion-foreman-office-app, PartPulse, R_Roster)
- Ripple scope: Protocol + 3 templates + agent contract updates (FM, builders, QA)

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: FCWT protocol addresses critical governance gap identified in FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md
- Gap addressed: Applications marked "complete" based solely on automated test pass rates without comprehensive functional testing
- Solution: Mandatory FCWT protocol with 10 comprehensive steps, evidence requirements, and formal handover

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: All governance artifacts updated correctly
- CANON_INVENTORY.json: Valid JSON, entry added, total count updated
- GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md: Protocol and templates added
- CHANGELOG.md: Comprehensive entry with migration guidance
- Session memory rotation: Ready to archive session-029 (oldest) when this session is committed

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE - FCWT governance protocol established

All acceptance criteria from issue met:
- [x] FCWT governance template and checklist drafted, reviewed, and archived
- [x] Full FCWT protocol described in process doc (for repeatability, onboarding)
- [x] Process for requesting/obtaining test seeds/data from FM/owner covered (Section 6.2)
- [x] Evidence chain: all FCWT materials (logs, seed data, walkthrough, checklist, handover contract) defined (Section 7)
- [x] Block release until all 3 formal functional closure definitions tested/declared (Section 5)
- [x] FCWT referenced in final workflow, closure, and post-mortem/canonization steps (Section 8)

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
1. **Template-driven approach**: Creating 3 comprehensive templates (checklist, handover, summary) provides clear structure for FCWT execution
2. **Integration with existing canon**: FCWT builds on FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md and WAVE_MODEL.md rather than creating parallel governance
3. **Evidence-first design**: .fcwt-evidence/ directory structure makes audit compliance straightforward
4. **Detailed protocol steps**: 10-step protocol with specific requirements prevents ambiguity and ensures thoroughness

### What Was Challenging
1. **Balancing comprehensiveness vs. practicality**: FCWT must be thorough but not so burdensome it becomes a checkbox exercise
2. **Template size**: Templates are large (15-18KB each) - comprehensive but may overwhelm; future iterations could add "quick start" guides
3. **Test debt policy clarity**: Balancing "zero test debt" principle with practical need to create tests during FCWT required careful policy definition

### What Future Sessions Should Know
1. **FCWT is mandatory, not optional**: FCWT MUST be executed before audit sign-off; no exceptions, no shortcuts
2. **Video walkthrough is critical**: 10-30 minute video provides most compelling evidence of working application; highly recommended, not optional
3. **Seed data quality matters**: Realistic, comprehensive seed data (50+ audits, 100+ criteria, 200+ evidence) enables meaningful testing
4. **FM/owner input protocol**: FCWT executor MUST prompt for guidance when needed and BLOCK until received (no guessing)
5. **Evidence archive is audit gold**: .fcwt-evidence/ directory becomes single source of truth for audit sign-off

### Governance Insights
1. **Closure checkpoints prevent drift**: FCWT as formal closure checkpoint between waves and audit prevents "tests pass = done" false completion
2. **Handover contracts create accountability**: Formal contract with executor/FM/CS2 sign-off establishes clear responsibility chain
3. **Three definitions framework**: Validating against "fully functional design/app/delivery" provides comprehensive closure criteria
4. **Test debt clearing**: Allowing FCWT-specific tests with post-sign-off clearing balances thoroughness with governance principles
5. **Integration over isolation**: FCWT strengthens existing governance (FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD, WAVE_MODEL) rather than creating new parallel process

## Next Actions

1. **Await CS2 Approval**: PR review and approval for FCWT protocol
2. **Execute Ripple**: After approval, propagate FCWT protocol and templates to all consumer repositories
3. **Update Agent Contracts**: Update FM, UI Builder, and QA agent contracts to reference FCWT responsibilities
4. **Plan MAT FCWT**: Schedule FCWT execution for MAT module (first application to use protocol)
5. **Monitor FCWT Usage**: Collect feedback from first FCWT execution to refine protocol and templates
