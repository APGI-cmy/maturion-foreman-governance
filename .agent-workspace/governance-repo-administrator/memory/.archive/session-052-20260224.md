## Task
Create governance canon for the Independent Assurance Agent (IAA): new `assurance` agent class, five-phase delivery proof protocol, agent integrity reference store, and merge gate enforcement. Issue: "Create Governance Canon: Independent Assurance Agent (IAA) — Agent Class, Contract Standard & Five-Phase Delivery Proof Protocol".

## What I Did

### Actions Taken
- Action 1: Created `INDEPENDENT_ASSURANCE_AGENT_CANON.md` covering all required sections per issue (IAA class def, independence requirements, hard-trigger authority, five-phase proof protocol, trigger table, binary output spec, agent integrity obligations, roles per delivery)
- Action 2: Created `governance/quality/agent-integrity/` folder with README, INTEGRITY_INDEX, and reference copies of all three active agent contracts
- Action 3: Updated `THREE_TIER_AGENT_KNOWLEDGE_ARCHITECTURE.md` to register `assurance` class in the Agent Class Applications table
- Action 4: Updated `CANON_INVENTORY.json` to add entry 181 for the new IAA canon with correct SHA256
- Action 5: Updated `GATE_REQUIREMENTS_INDEX.json` to add `iaa_assurance_gate` enforcement gate
- Action 6: Added `iaa-assurance-check` (Job 4) to `.github/workflows/merge-gate-interface.yml` with path/label-based trigger detection and ASSURANCE-TOKEN validation
- Action 7: Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with IAA-001 entry

### Decisions Made
- Decision 1: SHA256 hashes computed from live files at time of session for the initial INTEGRITY_INDEX baseline — consistent with existing canon management pattern
- Decision 2: `iaa-assurance-check` uses label-based AND path-based triggers (either triggers IAA requirement) — more robust than label-only
- Decision 3: IAA job added as Job 4 in merge-gate-interface.yml (not as separate workflow) — keeps all gate logic in one place per REQ-MGI-001
- Decision 4: Trigger table excludes docs-only/parking-station PRs — consistent with existing merge gate classification approach

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: This session memory file
- Status: All 11 files created/updated; CANON_INVENTORY entry 181 recorded

### Ripple Status
- Status: INTERNAL — no layer-down ripple required (governance repo only, no consumer APIs changed)
- Ripple required: NO

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: IAA governance gap fully addressed — independent assurance class now codified

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: CANON_INVENTORY updated; CHANGELOG updated; gate requirements updated; session memory created

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Using existing canon file format (STATUS/Version/Authority header) made IAA canon consistent with all other canon files
- Path-based AND label-based trigger detection in the merge gate job provides defence-in-depth

### What Was Challenging
- Session from previous run did not push due to 403 permission error — retry in new session resolved it

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- The `governance/quality/agent-integrity/` reference copies must be updated (CS2 only) whenever a corresponding `.github/agents/` file is updated via CS2-approved PR
- The INTEGRITY_INDEX.md SHA256 values must be recomputed after any agent contract update
- IAA agent contract instantiation (the actual agent file) is Step 2 per the issue — NOT done in this session

### Governance Insights
- Independence requirement (assurer ≠ performer) is the core structural safeguard — it must be enforced both at workflow level (CI) and canon level
- Binary output (PASS/FAIL, no partial credit) reduces ambiguity and prevents gate-dodging
