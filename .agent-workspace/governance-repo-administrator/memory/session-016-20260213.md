### Actions Taken
- Action 1: Executed wake-up protocol per REQ-AS-005
- Action 2: Retrieved and validated source files from maturion-isms with SHA256 checksums
- Action 3: Created governance/strategy/ directory (new structural addition)
- Action 4: Layered-up three governance files from maturion-isms
- Action 5: Updated CANON_INVENTORY.json with full SHA256 checksums and provenance

- Decision 2: Used exact SHA256 checksums from maturion-isms evidence package for validation
- Decision 3: Classified change as MODERATE BREAKING CHANGE due to new mandatory stage, but maintained backward compatibility through incremental adoption
- Decision 4: Updated CANON_INVENTORY with layer_down_status: PUBLIC_API for all three files (strategy, policy, template)
- Decision 5: Documented comprehensive migration path in CHANGELOG for consumer repositories
=======
- Session ID: copilot-fix-event-type-mismatch
- Branch: copilot/fix-event-type-mismatch

## Task
Fix critical event_type mismatch in governance ripple dispatch workflow that was blocking automated cross-repo governance synchronization.

## What I Did
### Files Modified (Auto-populated)
1. `.github/workflows/governance-ripple-dispatch.yml` (SHA256: a14f5d48d242550899e173874bc01a3ba16a475b643fe8000353306841f7d247)
   - Line 53: Changed `event_type="governance-ripple"` to `event_type="governance_ripple"`

### Actions Taken
- Action 1: Executed wake-up protocol per REQ-AS-005
- Action 2: Analyzed canonical protocol CROSS_REPO_RIPPLE_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL.md (line 50)
- Action 3: Identified mismatch between sender (hyphen) and canonical spec (underscore)
- Action 4: Applied minimal surgical change to line 53 of workflow file
- Action 5: Verified alignment with CONSUMER_REPO_REGISTRY.json (4 enabled consumers)
- Action 6: Ran code review (passed with 0 comments)
- Action 7: Ran CodeQL security check (0 alerts)

### Decisions Made
- Decision 1: Single-line change approach to maintain minimal modification principle (REQ-CM-001)
- Decision 2: No test modification needed as workflow is infrastructure-level and tested via live execution
- Decision 3: This is a syntax alignment fix, not a constitutional semantic change, so within authority boundary per REQ-AS-001

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
<<<<<<< copilot/upgrade-governance-stage-trs
- Evidence log: All changes committed in 3 git commits
- Status: Complete with full SHA256 validation
- Wake-up protocol: Executed successfully
- Session closure: Pending (this memory creation)

### Ripple Status
- Status: Layer-up complete, layer-down ripple required
- Ripple required: YES - Layer-down to 4 consumer repositories
- Ripple scope: maturion-isms (confirmation), maturion-foreman-office-app, PartPulse, R_Roster
- Ripple mechanism: governance-ripple-dispatch.yml workflow triggers after merge

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: No gaps detected during layer-up
- Gap addressed: Closed governance gap between FRS and Architecture by introducing TRS stage
- Impact: Prevents downstream implementation failures due to missing technical specifications

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: All governance requirements followed
- Hygiene issues detected: None
- Validation: JSON syntax validated, markdown files created successfully
- Code review: Completed with 1 non-blocking comment
- Security scan: Completed (no code changes)
=======
- Evidence log: Git commit 9cba2e1 (Fix event_type mismatch: governance-ripple → governance_ripple)
- Status: ✅ Complete - minimal change committed and validated

### Ripple Status
- Status: No ripple required - this is an infrastructure fix
- Ripple required: NO (workflow change only, no canon changes)

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: Addressed canonical protocol alignment gap
- Gap: Event type mismatch between dispatch and protocol specification
- Resolution: Workflow now conforms to CROSS_REPO_RIPPLE_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL.md

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: ✅ Clean - wake-up protocol executed, session closure protocol in progress
- CANON_INVENTORY integrity: Validated (no changes to canon)
- Working contract: Generated at session start
>>>>>>> main

## Outcome

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Lesson 1: Wake-up protocol provided excellent context and environment health check at session start
- Lesson 2: SHA256 checksum validation against source evidence package ensured file integrity
- Lesson 3: Layer-up protocol from maturion-isms was well-documented with complete evidence package
- Lesson 4: Creating governance/strategy/ directory as new structure was straightforward and logical
- Lesson 5: CANON_INVENTORY Python script update approach was efficient and maintainable

### What Was Challenging
- Challenge 1: Initial file creation with `create` tool failed due to timing issue with directory creation - resolved by using bash cat/heredoc
- Challenge 2: Understanding the full context of the layer-up request required reading multiple documents (issue, layer-up doc, source files)
- Challenge 3: Ensuring all inventory files were synchronized required careful attention to detail

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- Recommendation 1: Always run wake-up protocol first to load agent identity and context
- Recommendation 2: For layer-up requests, validate SHA256 checksums against source evidence package
- Recommendation 3: When creating new directories, use bash mkdir first before creating files
- Recommendation 4: Update CANON_INVENTORY.json using Python script for consistency
- Recommendation 5: Always update GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md and CHANGELOG.md together
- Recommendation 6: Code review should be run before security scan (REQ-EO-006 before REQ-SS-004)

### Governance Insights
- Insight 1: TRS stage fills critical gap between functional requirements and architecture - prevents late-discovery technical failures
- Insight 2: Layer-up protocol is working well - evidence-based governance evolution is effective
- Insight 3: Breaking changes can maintain backward compatibility through incremental adoption strategies
- Insight 4: Comprehensive migration guidance in CHANGELOG is essential for consumer repository adoption
- Insight 5: SHA256 checksum validation ensures file integrity across layer-up operations
