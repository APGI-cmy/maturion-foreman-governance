## Agent
- Type: governance-repo-administrator
- Session ID: 20260216-090638
- Branch: copilot/governance-gap-analysis-again

## Context
- Issue: N/A
- Purpose: Multi-repository governance gap analysis and ripple alignment across 4 consumer repositories

## Actions Taken

- Executed wake-up protocol and loaded governance context
- Performed comprehensive gap analysis across 4 consumer repositories
- Developed 4-wave ripple alignment strategy
- Created PartPulse critical compliance ripple issue
- Created CS2 escalation for repository status decision
- Generated final summary report for CS2 sign-off
- Created session memory per Living Agent System v6.2.0

## Decisions Made

- Use R_Roster as reference implementation due to 97/100 compliance score
- Prioritize PartPulse P0 CRITICAL for missing CANON_INVENTORY.json
- Escalate PartPulse repository status to CS2 as authority boundary decision
- Adopt 4-wave phased approach to prevent rework and manage dependencies
- Target compliance scores of 80/100 minimum for all repositories

## Lessons Learned

- Delegation to general-purpose agent with GitHub MCP access highly efficient for cross-repo analysis
- Reference implementation approach simplifies comparison and recommendation development
- Phased wave strategy with dependencies prevents rework from naming changes
- Proactive CS2 escalation for authority boundaries prevents wasted effort
- Evidence-first documentation enables objective decision-making

## Patterns Observed

- Cross-repository governance drift occurs naturally without enforcement
- Reference implementations accelerate compliance in other repos
- Authority boundary decisions require early CS2 escalation
- Phased dependencies prevent rework in multi-wave ripples

## Next Session Recommendations

- Await CS2 approval for PartPulse status and ripple strategy
- Create remaining ripple issue templates for Waves 2-4 post-approval
- Initialize RIPPLE_EXECUTION_LOG.md with multi-repo entries
- Monitor ripple execution per wave and update log
- Plan post-ripple review after Wave 4 completion
