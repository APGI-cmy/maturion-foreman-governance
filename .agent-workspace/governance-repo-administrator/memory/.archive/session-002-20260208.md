# Session 002 - 20260208

## Task
Conduct comprehensive governance gap analysis for Foreman POLC, learning loop, failure protocols, and agent authority alignment per issue request.

## What I Did
**Files Created (6 new canonical files)**:
1. GOVERNANCE_GAP_ANALYSIS_FINDINGS.md - Comprehensive gap analysis (16.4 KB)
2. governance/canon/WAVE_MODEL.md - Canonical wave model v1.0.0 (15.8 KB)
3. governance/canon/WE_ONLY_FAIL_ONCE_DOCTRINE.md - Failure-once doctrine v1.0.0 (17.3 KB)
4. governance/canon/CATASTROPHIC_FAILURE_PROTOCOL.md - Catastrophic failure protocol v1.0.0 (17.2 KB)
5. governance/canon/TARP_PROTOCOL.md - Threat Assessment & Response Protocol v1.0.0 (13.8 KB)
6. governance/canon/LEARNING_LOOP_CATEGORIES_AND_LIFECYCLE.md - Learning categories v1.0.0 (12.3 KB)
7. IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md - Session tracking and remaining work

**Analysis Completed**:
- Scanned 28 governance canon files and 4 constitutional files
- Identified 8 new files required and 4 updates needed
- Assessed Foreman POLC (✅ complete), agent authority (✅ complete), learning loop (⚠️ partial), failure protocols (❌ missing)

## Ripple Status
**NOT YET EXECUTED** - Governance ripple required after CS2 review and approval of new canonical files. GOVERNANCE_RIPPLE_CHECKLIST_PROTOCOL.md must be executed to propagate these changes.

**Ripple Scope**:
- Update GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md
- Update agent contracts (FM, Builder, governance-liaison)
- Propagate to consumer repos (via governance-liaison)
- Validate all cross-references

## Outcome
⚠️ PARTIAL - 75% complete (6 of 8 new files created)

**Remaining Work**:
- 2 new files needed (FOREMAN_MEMORY_PROTOCOL.md, FOREMAN_WAVE_PLANNING_AND_ISSUE_ARTIFACT_GENERATION_PROTOCOL.md)
- 4 file updates needed (FM_ROLE_CANON.md, STOP_AND_FIX_DOCTRINE.md, BOOTSTRAP_EXECUTION_LEARNINGS.md, GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md)
- Governance ripple execution

## Lessons
**What Worked**:
- Systematic gap analysis methodology was effective
- Creating foundational files first (WAVE_MODEL, WE_ONLY_FAIL_ONCE) provided strong base
- Integration points clearly documented in each canonical file
- Constitutional authority chain maintained throughout

**What Was Challenging**:
- Large scope (8 new files + 4 updates + ripple) exceeded single session capacity
- Balancing completeness vs. time efficiency
- Ensuring all cross-references accurate across 6 new files
- Maintaining constitutional authority chain and integration consistency

**For Next Session**:
- Prioritize FOREMAN_MEMORY_PROTOCOL.md (CRITICAL for Living Agent System v5.0.0)
- Complete FM_ROLE_CANON.md updates (Sections 12-13)
- Update GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md before ripple
- Execute ripple only after CS2 reviews new canonical files

---
**Key Achievement**: Addressed CRITICAL GAP - WAVE_MODEL.md now exists (was referenced in multiple files but didn't exist)
