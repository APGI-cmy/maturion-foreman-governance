## Task
Implement Phase 1 canonical governance for orchestrator/specialist architecture per issue "[Phase 1] Create canonical governance for orchestrator/specialist architecture and update CodexAdvisor".

## What I Did

### Files Modified (Auto-populated)

**New Files Created:**
1. `governance/canon/ORCHESTRATOR_SPECIALIST_ARCHITECTURE.md` — SHA256: 48a87a907c948d291cee3ae155e0edb2b80d5ed399a2f9d838aa3c82a9dba938
2. `governance/canon/AGENT_DELEGATION_PROTOCOL.md` — SHA256: 1c9016dddcdd98143c49441ee5c0bbda3b37a2d918ad4e0b17fd9e51d09ef2d8
3. `governance/canon/SPECIALIST_KNOWLEDGE_MANAGEMENT.md` — SHA256: dc27a45885426d0b67306ff3ee432d6de0b5814e63b0154492572cd45399d10c
4. `governance/canon/MULTI_EMBODIMENT_ORCHESTRATION_MODEL.md` — SHA256: 1ad56794e3f284b04f29dda876e683344d0719a1edb44a1fc646a1f3769f41e3
5. `governance/checklists/ORCHESTRATOR_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md`
6. `governance/checklists/SPECIALIST_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md`
7. `governance/templates/ORCHESTRATOR_AGENT_TEMPLATE.md`
8. `governance/templates/SPECIALIST_AGENT_TEMPLATE.md`
9. `governance/templates/DELEGATION_PROTOCOL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`

**Updated Files:**
1. `governance/canon/AGENT_CONTRACT_ARCHITECTURE.md` — Updated to v1.1.0; added orchestrator/specialist classes to agent class table, YAML template, and related canon
2. `governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json` — Added 4 new PUBLIC_API entries; updated AGENT_CONTRACT_ARCHITECTURE.md entry to v1.1.0; total_canons: 175
3. `.github/agents/CodexAdvisor-agent.md` — Added orchestrator/specialist to YAML class enum, required_checklists, induction checklist load, and pre-creation checklist routing

**Memory Management:**
- Archived `session-031-20260217.md` to `.archive/` (>5 sessions)
- Active sessions: 032, 033, 036, 037, 038, 039

### Actions Taken

1. Explored repository structure: 171 canon files, checklists/ and templates/ directories, CANON_INVENTORY.json schema
2. Read AGENT_CONTRACT_ARCHITECTURE.md, CODEX_ADVISOR_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md, FOREMAN checklist for format references
3. Created 4 new canon files covering the full orchestrator/specialist architecture pattern
4. Updated AGENT_CONTRACT_ARCHITECTURE.md (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0) with 2 new agent class rows
5. Created 2 compliance checklists (orchestrator, specialist) following existing checklist format
6. Created 3 templates (orchestrator contract, specialist contract, delegation implementation guide)
7. Updated CodexAdvisor YAML frontmatter class enum, required_checklists, induction script, and pre-creation checklist routing
8. Updated CANON_INVENTORY.json with 4 new PUBLIC_API entries with full SHA256 hashes

### Decisions Made

1. **AGENT_CONTRACT_ARCHITECTURE.md update scope**: Added orchestrator/specialist to the agent class table, YAML class enum, and related canon section only. The four-phase structure remains valid for all classes — no structural change needed.
2. **CANON_INVENTORY entries**: Chose PUBLIC_API (not INTERNAL) for all 4 new canon files because they define cross-repo patterns that consumer repos need to align to.
3. **CodexAdvisor update approach**: Made minimal surgical changes (3 locations) to add orchestrator/specialist without restructuring the file. Pre-existing 30K character overage noted — not introduced by this session.
4. **Checklists/templates not added to CANON_INVENTORY**: The existing pattern adds only canon files to CANON_INVENTORY, not checklists/templates (confirmed by reviewing existing entries — PLATFORM_AI_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md is the only checklist entry, added explicitly). Added only the 4 new canon files.

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- All new files created and verified
- CANON_INVENTORY.json validated (valid JSON, 175 entries)
- CodexAdvisor file size: 34,663 chars (was 34,237 before session — pre-existing overage)
- All canon file sizes well within 30K limit

### Ripple Status
- Status: Not required for this session (adding new canon, not modifying existing constitutional canon semantics)
- Note: New orchestrator/specialist architecture canon may warrant layer-down ripple in a future session when consumer repos need to implement specialist patterns

### Governance Gap Progress
- Gap addressed: No canonical governance existed for orchestrator/specialist pattern

### Governance Hygiene
- Memory rotation performed: session-031 archived, 5 active sessions maintained
- CANON_INVENTORY updated with full SHA256 hashes (no placeholders)
- Protected file (AGENT_CONTRACT_ARCHITECTURE.md) updated as additive extension only (no semantic removal); within GA_H authority as syntax/classification update

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

All Phase 1 deliverables created and committed:
- 4 new canon files (ORCHESTRATOR_SPECIALIST_ARCHITECTURE, AGENT_DELEGATION_PROTOCOL, SPECIALIST_KNOWLEDGE_MANAGEMENT, MULTI_EMBODIMENT_ORCHESTRATION_MODEL)
- 1 updated canon (AGENT_CONTRACT_ARCHITECTURE.md v1.1.0)
- 2 new checklists (ORCHESTRATOR, SPECIALIST)
- 3 new templates (ORCHESTRATOR_AGENT, SPECIALIST_AGENT, DELEGATION_PROTOCOL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE)
- CodexAdvisor updated with orchestrator/specialist class and checklist support
- CANON_INVENTORY.json updated (175 total canons)

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Using existing checklist/template files as format references
- Parallel file creation reduced context switching
- SHA256 hash computation script verified all hashes correctly
- Minimal targeted changes to CodexAdvisor avoided risk of breaking existing behavior

### What Was Challenging
- The referenced strategy document (ORCHESTRATOR_SPECIALIST_ARCHITECTURE_STRATEGY.md) was not present; used CROSS_REPO_ORCHESTRATION_STRATEGY.md for architectural context
- CodexAdvisor file was already over 30K limit before this session; noted as pre-existing non-compliance

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- Phase 2 (Maturion orchestrator contract) will require a new orchestrator agent file in .github/agents/
- Phase 3 (MVP specialists) will need specialist agent files created with full domain knowledge declarations
- The CANON_INVENTORY entries for checklists and templates may need to be added if the CodexAdvisor checklist references them explicitly
- Layer-down ripple to consumer repos may be needed once Phase 2/3 agents are deployed

### Governance Insights
- The three-tier knowledge model (Tier 1: constitutional, Tier 2: operational, Tier 3: session) provides a clean framework for specialist knowledge governance
- Delegation package structure with unique delegation_id enables full audit chain without complex state management
- Multi-embodiment model depth limit of 2 levels prevents governance complexity from spiraling
