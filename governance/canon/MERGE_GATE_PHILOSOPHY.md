# MERGE GATE PHILOSOPHY

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Date**: 2026-01-20  
**Status**: Active  
**Type**: Constitutional Governance Rule  
**Authority**: Supreme - Canonical  
**Owner**: CS2 (Johan Ras in bootstrap mode, Maturion in production)

---

## Core Principle

**CI is confirmatory, NOT diagnostic.**

Agents validate locally BEFORE creating PRs. Merge gates confirm what the agent already proved.

---

## Agent Responsibilities (BEFORE PR)

**Agent MUST validate locally**:

### 1. Code Quality
- **100% builds**: No compilation errors
- **Zero warnings**: All warnings treated as errors
- **Zero deprecations**: BL-026 compliance (no deprecated API usage)
- **All tests passing**: 100% green, no skips, no suppressions

### 2. Governance Compliance
- **SCOPE_DECLARATION.md created and validated**: Matches git diff exactly
- **YAML syntax validated**: `yamllint` exit code 0 (BL-028)
- **All applicable gates run locally**: Exit code 0 for ALL gates
- **No manual verification shortcuts**: Execute actual scripts, not mental validation

### 3. Evidence Documentation
- **PREHANDOVER_PROOF.md created**: Mandatory handover evidence
- **Contains actual commands executed**: Exact commands, not paraphrases
- **Contains exit codes**: All must be 0 (PASS)
- **Contains timestamps**: When validation occurred

**Agent runs merge gate checks IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT** (not in CI)

---

## Merge Gate Responsibilities

**Merge gates check**:

### 1. Evidence Exists
**Primary Mode**: PREHANDOVER_PROOF.md with gate-specific keywords
- Gate looks for evidence file
- Gate searches for keywords matching gate name
- If found → SKIP execution, PASS gate immediately
- Fast, agent-proven quality

### 2. Governance Compliance
**Simple Checks**: File exists, format valid
- Not complex re-validation
- Not diagnostic testing
- Simple structure and presence checks

### 3. No Fancy Validation
**Gates do NOT**:
- Re-run complex validation that agent should have run
- Perform diagnostic analysis
- Discover failures (agent already caught them)
- Act as primary quality enforcement

---

## Two Validation Modes

### Mode 1: Evidence-Based (Preferred)

**Process**:
1. Agent provides PREHANDOVER_PROOF.md
2. Gate checks for keywords matching gate name
3. If found → SKIP execution, PASS gate
4. Fast, agent-proven quality

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Fast CI execution (skips re-validation)
- ✅ Trusts agent evidence (agent already validated)
- ✅ Reduces CI resource usage
- ✅ Encourages proper pre-gate validation

**Keywords per Gate**:
- Scope-to-Diff: `"Scope Declaration"|"scope-to-diff"`
- YAML Validation: `"yamllint"|"YAML"`
- Governance Compliance: `"Governance Compliance"`
- Agent Governance: `"Agent.*Governance"|"Agent.*Contract"`
- FM Effectiveness: `"FM.*Effectiveness"|"Effectiveness"`
- FM Failure Enforcement: `"Failure.*Enforcement"|"FM.*Failure"`
- FM Failure Promotion: `"Failure.*Promotion"`
- FM Learning Promotion: `"Learning.*Promotion"`

### Mode 2: Script Execution (Fallback)

**Process**:
1. No PREHANDOVER_PROOF found
2. Gate runs validation script
3. Exit code must be 0 to pass
4. Slower, CI-validated quality

**When Used**:
- Agent didn't provide PREHANDOVER_PROOF
- Agent forgot to document gate validation
- Legacy PRs before evidence-based model
- Non-agent PR contributors

---

## Evidence-Based Validation Pattern

**Standard Pattern for ALL Gates**:

```yaml
- name: Check for Evidence-Based Validation (BL-027/028)
  id: evidence_check
  run: |
    echo "=== Evidence-Based Validation Check (BL-027/028) ==="
    echo "Gate: [GATE NAME]"
    echo ""
    
    # Look for PREHANDOVER_PROOF with this gate documented
    if [ -f "PREHANDOVER_PROOF.md" ] && grep -qi "[gate-keyword]" PREHANDOVER_PROOF.md; then
      echo "✅ Found PREHANDOVER_PROOF.md with [Gate] validation"
      echo "✅ ACCEPTING evidence-based validation per BL-027/028"
      echo "skip_execution=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    elif ls PREHANDOVER_PROOF_*.md 1> /dev/null 2>&1 && grep -qi "[gate-keyword]" PREHANDOVER_PROOF_*.md 2>/dev/null; then
      echo "✅ Found PREHANDOVER_PROOF with [Gate] validation"
      echo "✅ ACCEPTING evidence-based validation per BL-027/028"
      echo "skip_execution=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    else
      echo "ℹ️  No evidence-based validation found - proceeding with script execution"
      echo "skip_execution=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    fi

- name: [Original Gate Validation]
  if: steps.evidence_check.outputs.skip_execution != 'true'
  run: [original validation command]
```

**Key Elements**:
1. **Evidence check step**: Runs first, looks for PREHANDOVER_PROOF
2. **Keyword search**: Looks for gate-specific keywords
3. **Output variable**: Sets `skip_execution` based on evidence
4. **Conditional validation**: Original validation only runs if no evidence

---

## Gate Types

### 1. Governance Compliance Gates

**Purpose**: Ensure governance artifacts present and valid

**Examples**:
- Scope-to-Diff validation (BL-027)
- YAML syntax validation (BL-028)
- Governance binding validation

**Validation**: Simple file checks, format validation

**Evidence-Based**: ✅ Supported (PREHANDOVER_PROOF contains validation evidence)

---

### 2. Quality Gates

**Purpose**: Ensure code quality standards met

**Examples**:
- No warnings
- No deprecations (BL-026)
- 100% test passage

**Validation**: Evidence-based preferred (agent already ran checks)

**Evidence-Based**: ✅ Supported (PREHANDOVER_PROOF contains build/test evidence)

---

### 3. Evidence Gates

**Purpose**: Ensure handover evidence complete

**Examples**:
- PREHANDOVER_PROOF exists
- Required sections present
- Evidence complete

**Validation**: Document structure checks

**Evidence-Based**: ⚠️ Partial (checks existence, but validates structure in CI)

---

## Anti-Patterns (DO NOT)

### ❌ DO NOT

1. **Use CI to discover failures** (diagnostic)
   - Agent should catch failures locally first
   - CI confirms what agent already validated

2. **Run complex validation in CI that agent should have run**
   - Agent runs builds, tests, linters locally
   - CI confirms agent's work, doesn't redo it

3. **Infer state from PR comments or labels**
   - Use PREHANDOVER_PROOF file, not indirect signals
   - Explicit evidence, not implied state

4. **Make CI the source of truth**
   - Agent's pre-gate validation is source of truth
   - CI confirms, doesn't establish truth

5. **Skip evidence-based validation opportunities**
   - If agent provided evidence, use it
   - Don't waste CI resources re-running validation

---

### ✅ DO

1. **Trust agent evidence**
   - If PREHANDOVER_PROOF documents validation, accept it
   - Agent's local validation is authoritative

2. **Confirm what agent already proved**
   - Evidence-based validation confirms agent's work
   - Lightweight confirmation, not re-validation

3. **Keep gates simple**
   - Gates check presence and format
   - Complex validation belongs in agent's environment

4. **Use evidence-based validation**
   - Faster CI, trusts agent discipline
   - Encourages proper pre-gate validation

5. **Provide clear feedback when evidence missing**
   - Tell agent what evidence was expected
   - Guide agent to provide evidence next time

**Gate Behavior**:
1. Gate reads PREHANDOVER_PROOF.md
2. Gate finds keywords: "Scope-to-Diff", "YAML", etc.
3. Gate accepts evidence-based validation
4. Gate PASSES without re-running validation
5. Fast CI, agent-proven quality

---

## Benefits

### For Agents
- ✅ Clear expectations: validate locally first
- ✅ Fast feedback: CI confirms quickly
- ✅ Discipline reinforcement: must provide evidence
- ✅ Pre-gate validation becomes routine

### For CI/CD
- ✅ Reduced resource usage: skips re-validation
- ✅ Faster execution: evidence-based gates pass immediately
- ✅ Clearer purpose: confirmation, not diagnostics
- ✅ Better signal-to-noise: failures indicate real issues

### For Governance
- ✅ Enforces pre-gate validation (BL-027, BL-028)
- ✅ Creates audit trail (PREHANDOVER_PROOF)
- ✅ Aligns CI with philosophy (confirmatory not diagnostic)
- ✅ Reduces governance violations (agents validate first)

---
