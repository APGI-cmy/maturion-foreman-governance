# Session 049 — 2026-02-23 (Living Agent System v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: governance-repo-administrator
- Class: administrator
- Session ID: 049

## Task
CS2-authorized targeted addition of CANON-HASH-001 gate to `.github/agents/governance-repo-administrator-v2.agent.md` (Issue #1189). Change made via coding agent per self-modification prohibition protocol.

## What I Did

### Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `.github/agents/governance-repo-administrator-v2.agent.md` | Added CANON-HASH-001 line to Phase 4.1 Evidence block; added CANON-HASH-001 line to Execution Checklist; updated `last_updated` to 2026-02-23 |
| `.agent-workspace/governance-repo-administrator/memory/session-049-20260223.md` | Session memory created |
| `.agent-workspace/governance-repo-administrator/memory/PREHANDOVER-session-049-20260223.md` | PREHANDOVER proof created |
| `.agent-workspace/parking-station/suggestions-log.md` | Row appended |

### Actions Taken
- Action 1: Updated `last_updated` in YAML frontmatter from `2026-02-17` to `2026-02-23`
- Action 2: Added `✅ CANON-HASH-001: `.github/scripts/validate-canon-hashes.sh` run — 0 failures confirmed` to Phase 4.1 Evidence block immediately after CANON_INVENTORY integrity line
- Action 3: Added `- [ ] CANON-HASH-001: Run `.github/scripts/validate-canon-hashes.sh`; assert 0 failures before merge` to Execution Checklist immediately after CANON_INVENTORY integrity line
- Action 4: Created PREHANDOVER proof, session memory, and suggestions-log row

### Decisions Made
- Decision 1: Zero deletions — all three insertions match the exact wording specified in CS2 authorization (Issue #1189)
- Decision 2: No other changes to contract file per acceptance criteria

## PREHANDOVER Gate

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Execution Checklist contains CANON-HASH-001 line after CANON_INVENTORY integrity line | ✅ PASS |
| Phase 4.1 Evidence block contains CANON-HASH-001 evidence line | ✅ PASS |
| `last_updated` updated to 2026-02-23 in YAML frontmatter | ✅ PASS |
| No other changes to contract file | ✅ PASS |
| PREHANDOVER proof committed | ✅ PASS |
| Session memory created | ✅ PASS |
| suggestions-log.md row added | ✅ PASS |
| No direct main pushes; PR-only writes | ✅ PASS |

**PREHANDOVER Gate**: PASS

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: This session memory
- PR: copilot/add-canon-hash-001-gate
- CS2 Authorization: Issue #1189, references PR #1186

### Ripple Status
- Ripple required: NO (targeted agent contract addition, no constitutional canon semantic changes)

### Governance Gap Progress
- CANON-HASH-001 gap: CLOSED — validation script already committed (session-048); agent contract now updated with gate in both Evidence block and Execution Checklist

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE — All acceptance criteria met

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Surgical three-insertion approach matched CS2 specification exactly
- Prior session-048 work (validation script) meant only the agent contract needed updating

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- CANON-HASH-001 gate is now fully promoted: script at `.github/scripts/validate-canon-hashes.sh` AND agent contract checklist entries both present
- Run `validate-canon-hashes.sh` before any PREHANDOVER on CANON_INVENTORY.json changes
