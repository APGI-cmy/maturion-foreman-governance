# Session 016 - 20260213 (Living Agent System v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: governance-repo-administrator
- Class: administrator
- Session ID: copilot-fix-event-type-mismatch
- Branch: copilot/fix-event-type-mismatch

## Task
Fix critical event_type mismatch in governance ripple dispatch workflow that was blocking automated cross-repo governance synchronization.

## What I Did
### Files Modified (Auto-populated)
1. `.github/workflows/governance-ripple-dispatch.yml` (SHA256: a14f5d48d242550899e173874bc01a3ba16a475b643fe8000353306841f7d247)
   - Line 53: Changed `event_type="governance-ripple"` to `event_type="governance_ripple"`

### Actions Taken
- Action 1: Executed wake-up protocol per REQ-AS-005
- Action 2: Analyzed canonical protocol CROSS_REPO_RIPPLE_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL.md (line 50)
- Action 3: Identified mismatch between sender (hyphen) and canonical spec (underscore)
- Action 4: Applied minimal surgical change to line 53 of workflow file
- Action 5: Verified alignment with CONSUMER_REPO_REGISTRY.json (4 enabled consumers)
- Action 6: Ran code review (passed with 0 comments)
- Action 7: Ran CodeQL security check (0 alerts)

### Decisions Made
- Decision 1: Single-line change approach to maintain minimal modification principle (REQ-CM-001)
- Decision 2: No test modification needed as workflow is infrastructure-level and tested via live execution
- Decision 3: This is a syntax alignment fix, not a constitutional semantic change, so within authority boundary per REQ-AS-001

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: Git commit 9cba2e1 (Fix event_type mismatch: governance-ripple → governance_ripple)
- Status: ✅ Complete - minimal change committed and validated

### Ripple Status
- Status: No ripple required - this is an infrastructure fix
- Ripple required: NO (workflow change only, no canon changes)

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: Addressed canonical protocol alignment gap
- Gap: Event type mismatch between dispatch and protocol specification
- Resolution: Workflow now conforms to CROSS_REPO_RIPPLE_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL.md

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: ✅ Clean - wake-up protocol executed, session closure protocol in progress
- CANON_INVENTORY integrity: Validated (no changes to canon)
- Working contract: Generated at session start

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

**Fix successfully implemented:**
- Event_type changed from `governance-ripple` to `governance_ripple`
- Aligns with canonical protocol specification
- All 4 consumer repos (ISMS, PartPulse, R_Roster, Foreman Office App) can now receive ripple events
- Automated governance sync enabled across ecosystem

**Security Summary:**
- CodeQL analysis: 0 alerts
- No vulnerabilities introduced
- Change scope: Single line in workflow file

## Lessons
### What Worked Well
- Minimal change principle - single character modification (hyphen to underscore)
- Evidence-first approach - verified canonical protocol before making change
- Wake-up protocol provided complete context quickly
- Code review and CodeQL validation caught no issues

### What Was Challenging
- None - straightforward alignment fix with clear canonical specification

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- Event type naming convention: underscores for GitHub repository_dispatch events
- Always verify against canonical protocol documents before workflow changes
- CONSUMER_REPO_REGISTRY.json is the authoritative list of ripple consumers

### Governance Insights
- Canonical protocol (CROSS_REPO_RIPPLE_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL.md) correctly specified underscore format
- Mismatch was implementation drift in workflow file
- Living Agent System wake-up protocol efficiently provided all needed context
- Single-line fix restored system-wide governance ripple capability
