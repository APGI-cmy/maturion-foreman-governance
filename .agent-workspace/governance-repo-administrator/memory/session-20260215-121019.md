## Agent
- Type: governance-repo-administrator
- Session ID: 20260215-121019
- Branch: copilot/establish-post-mortem-protocol

## Context
- Issue: N/A
- Purpose: Establish universal post-mortem protocol for all agents

## Actions Taken

- Created POST_MORTEM_PROTOCOL.md canonical governance (24KB, 18 sections)
- Created 3 comprehensive templates (agent report, reconciliation, gap analysis)
- Created JSON Schema for automation
- Updated CANON_INVENTORY.json, GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md, CHANGELOG.md
- Validated all artifacts (JSON, code review, CodeQL)

## Decisions Made

- Universal agent participation - all agents must contribute for complete learning
- Evidence-based reporting - all findings must be supported by evidence
- Standards compliance tracking - formal assessment of ISO, OWASP, WCAG gaps
- PUBLIC_API layer-down status - recommended for all consumer repos

## Lessons Learned

- Discovery phase using search_code_subagent prevents integration conflicts
- Template-first approach validates protocol usability
- JSON Schema enables future automation
- Comprehensive CHANGELOG entry critical for CS2 approval

## Patterns Observed

- Canonical protocol creation follows predictable workflow
- Templates validate protocol usability
- Evidence-based governance evolution prevents speculation

## Next Session Recommendations

- Await CS2 approval before considering protocol effective
- After approval, plan layer-down to consumer repositories
- First build using protocol will generate example artifacts

## Handover State
- Status: COMPLETE
- Environment: CLEAN
- Notes: Session closure completed successfully
