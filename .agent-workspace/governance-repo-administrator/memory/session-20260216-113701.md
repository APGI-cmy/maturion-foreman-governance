## Agent
- Type: governance-repo-administrator
- Session ID: 20260216-113701
- Branch: copilot/define-delivery-standard

## Context
- Issue: N/A
- Purpose: Define fully functional delivery standards and strengthen wave gates

## Actions Taken

- Created FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md with explicit definitions
- Updated Foreman contract with wave authorization and closure requirements
- Updated WAVE_MODEL.md with deliverable verification requirements
- Updated CANON_INVENTORY.json and GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md
- Created comprehensive CHANGELOG.md entry with migration guidance
- Created session memory and updated personal learning files

## Decisions Made

- Created new Tier-1 Canon for fundamental gap - warranted dedicated standard
- Made standard PUBLIC_API for mandatory consumer ripple
- Defined three separate fully functional concepts for each stage
- Included structural enforcement not just documentation

## Lessons Learned

- Tested does not equal delivered - must verify physical deliverables
- Wave gates need structural enforcement not just documentation
- Explicit definitions prevent ambiguity in critical processes

## Patterns Observed

- Governance gaps have operational symptoms requiring structural fixes
- Explicit definitions prevent assumption-based failures
