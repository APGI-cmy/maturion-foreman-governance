## Gap Analysis

### Current State

**Agents to Update**: 3 agent files in `.github/agents/`:
1. `governance-repo-administrator.agent.md` (431 lines)
2. `CodexAdvisor-agent.md` (503 lines)
3. `agent-contract-administrator.md` (327 lines)

**Current Coverage**:
- ✅ All agents have some improvement proposal language
- ⚠️ No agents reference PREHANDOVER_PROOF v2.0.0 template explicitly
- ⚠️ No agents require Section 0 (4 governance artifacts) in completion checklists
- ⚠️ No agents require Section 9 (CST validation attestation)
- ⚠️ No agents reference Section 11 (FAQ)
- ⚠️ Improvement proposal language exists but not marked as MANDATORY/COMPULSORY across all agents
- ✅ `CodexAdvisor-agent.md` has strong improvement proposal section (Section 14)
- ⚠️ `governance-repo-administrator.agent.md` has improvement requirement but could be strengthened
- ⚠️ `agent-contract-administrator.md` has continuous improvement but not explicitly tied to MANDATORY_ENHANCEMENT_CAPTURE_STANDARD.md

### Identified Gaps

1. **PREHANDOVER_PROOF v2.0.0 Template Alignment**
   - Gap: No agents reference v2.0.0 template structure
   - Required: Add template reference with version number
   - Required: Enumerate Section 0, Section 9, Section 11 as mandatory

2. **4 Governance Artifacts (Section 0)**
   - Gap: No agents explicitly require all 4 artifacts in completion checklists
   - Required: Governance Scan, Risk Assessment, Change Record, Completion Summary
   - Impact: Missing systematic governance artifact enforcement

3. **CST Validation Attestation (Section 9)**
   - Gap: No agents require CST validation attestation with decision framework
   - Required: CST applicability determination, validation attestation, or justification
   - Impact: Missing integration validation enforcement

4. **FAQ Reference (Section 11)**
   - Gap: No agents reference 22-question FAQ for handover clarity
   - Required: Explicit reference to Section 11 as resource

5. **Mandatory Improvement Proposal Enforcement**
   - Gap: Language exists but not consistently marked as MANDATORY across all agents
   - Required: Explicit "MANDATORY", "COMPULSORY" language in all agent contracts
   - Required: Tie to MANDATORY_ENHANCEMENT_CAPTURE_STANDARD.md v2.0.0
   - Required: Both feature enhancement AND process improvement reflection

### Required Updates

All three agent files require updates to:
1. Reference PREHANDOVER_PROOF v2.0.0 template explicitly
2. Require Section 0 (4 governance artifacts) in completion checklists
3. Require Section 9 (CST validation attestation) with decision framework
4. Reference Section 11 (22-question FAQ) as resource
5. Strengthen mandatory improvement proposal language with MANDATORY/COMPULSORY markers
6. Update completion checklists to enforce v2.0.0 compliance

## Scan Conclusion

**Status**: ✅ Ready to proceed with identified gaps

**Recommendation**: PROCEED with agent file updates

**Rationale**:
- All governance bindings are clear and accessible
- Gaps are well-defined and remediable
- No governance conflicts detected
- Constitutional principles support the work
- Authority is clear (EXECUTION_BOOTSTRAP_PROTOCOL.md v2.0.0+, MANDATORY_ENHANCEMENT_CAPTURE_STANDARD.md v2.0.0)
- Repository context confirmed (governance source)
- Agent context confirmed (3 agents in this repo)

**Next Step**: Create risk assessment for agent file modifications
