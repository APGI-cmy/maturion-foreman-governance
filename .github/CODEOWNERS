# CODEOWNERS — Maturion Foreman Governance
#
# AMENDMENT AUTHORITY: CS2 (Johan Ras / @APGI-cmy) ONLY
# This file is itself protected — any change requires @APGI-cmy approval.
#
# Purpose: Defines ownership of critical governance files.
#          These paths require explicit CS2 approval before ANY PR can merge.
#          This file is the manual "unlock gate" for .github/agents/ changes.

# Policy reference: governance/canon/AGENT_CONTRACT_FILE_PROTECTION_POLICY.md

# ===========================================================================
# AGENT CONTRACT FILES — ABSOLUTE LOCK (CONSTITUTIONAL)
#
# @APGI-cmy is the SOLE owner. No merge permitted without explicit CS2
# approval. This is the manual "unlock" gate — CS2 approving this PR IS
# the authorisation for CodexAdvisor to have made these changes.
#
# Per AGENT_CONTRACT_FILE_PROTECTION_POLICY.md §1:
# No agent other than CodexAdvisor (with explicit CS2 permission) may
# modify these files. All other agents are PROHIBITED.
