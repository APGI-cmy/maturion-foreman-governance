### Actions Taken

1. **Exploration Phase**:
   - Located source material: `maturion/strategy/MATURION_AI_MANAGEMENT_CENTRE_STRATEGY.md`
   - Verified PR #1182 provenance (commit 6cd642c5932788d571d6ec16a5c7c63e05fd2c2e)
   - Examined CANON_INVENTORY structure and schema
   - Reviewed related canons (COGNITIVE_CAPABILITY_ORCHESTRATION_MODEL, THREE_TIER_AGENT_KNOWLEDGE_ARCHITECTURE)
   - Checked CHANGELOG format and conventions

2. **Canon Creation**:
   - Created `governance/canon/AIMC_STRATEGY.md` v1.0.0
   - Structured with 12 sections covering:
     - Purpose and strategic mandate
     - Constitutional mandate and authority
     - Architectural overview (Gateway, Router, Capability Registry, Handlers, Personas, Memory Manager, Provider Adapters)
     - 8 capability types (advisory, analysis, deep-search, image-generation, video-generation, document-generation, embeddings, algorithm-execution)
     - Provider strategy (GitHub Models, OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, Runway)
     - Memory Centre architecture (session + persistent, Supabase backbone)
     - Agent personas (namespace separation from build agents)
     - 6-phase build sequence
     - 9 constitutional governance principles
     - Relationship to existing governance
     - Enforcement and compliance requirements
     - References and provenance
   - Calculated SHA256 hash: dfe539fe290148e6e7c9112fa269b5cd0124c456954de1d75c9a7870cd79b2dc

3. **CANON_INVENTORY Update**:
   - Added new entry with all required fields per schema
   - Included optional fields (canonical_version, local_version, local_extension, layer_up_status)
   - Updated total_canons counter and last_updated timestamp
   - Used Python script for safe JSON manipulation

4. **CHANGELOG Update**:
   - Created comprehensive [AIMC-STRATEGY-CANONIZATION] entry
   - Documented CS2 approval via PR #1182
   - Listed all 6 affected artifacts with SHA256 hashes
   - Provided migration guidance for consumer repos
   - Explained rationale (6 points) and impact (6 points)
   - Added references to source material and related canons

5. **Governance Artifact Inventory Update**:
   - Added AIMC_STRATEGY.md entry in alphabetical order
   - Categorized as Layer-down, Readiness, PR-gates
   - Updated Last Updated timestamp

6. **Ripple/Alignment**:
   - Updated COGNITIVE_CAPABILITY_ORCHESTRATION_MODEL.md to reference AIMC (build-time vs runtime namespace)
   - Updated THREE_TIER_AGENT_KNOWLEDGE_ARCHITECTURE.md to reference AIMC embeddings capability
   - No GATE_REQUIREMENTS_INDEX.json update needed (file is JSON schema, not narrative)

### Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Structured AIMC canon as full governance document, not just strategy reference
   - **Rationale**: Constitutional canon requires self-contained authority, not dependency on external strategy docs
   - **Evidence**: Other PUBLIC_API canons (COGNITIVE_CAPABILITY_ORCHESTRATION_MODEL, THREE_TIER_AGENT_KNOWLEDGE_ARCHITECTURE) are comprehensive standalone documents

2. **Decision**: Included all 9 governance principles verbatim from source
   - **Rationale**: These are constitutional rules that must be explicitly stated and enforceable
   - **Evidence**: LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md pattern — governance principles are first-class sections

3. **Decision**: Added namespace separation warnings in multiple sections
   - **Rationale**: Critical to prevent confusion between build agents (`.github/agents/`) and app personas (`packages/ai-centre/agents/`)
   - **Evidence**: Section 7.6, Section 9 Principle 7, Section 10.3 all reinforce separation

4. **Decision**: Cross-referenced COGNITIVE_CAPABILITY_ORCHESTRATION_MODEL and THREE_TIER_AGENT_KNOWLEDGE_ARCHITECTURE
   - **Rationale**: Clarify relationship and prevent overlap/conflict
   - **Evidence**: COGNITIVE handles build-time, AIMC handles runtime; THREE_TIER provides knowledge architecture, AIMC implements embeddings

5. **Decision**: Used Python for CANON_INVENTORY.json update
   - **Rationale**: jq with large files (98KB, 2003 lines) can corrupt output
   - **Evidence**: First attempt with jq produced empty file; Python script succeeded

6. **Decision**: Did not update GATE_REQUIREMENTS_INDEX.json
   - **Rationale**: That file is machine-readable schema for gate classifications, not narrative governance
   - **Evidence**: File structure is JSON with patterns/required_checks, not canonical references

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: Session memory (this file)
- Status: Complete — all artifacts created and updated

### Ripple Status
- Status: Ripple complete within governance repo
- Ripple required: YES — layer-down ripple to maturion-isms required per CROSS_REPOSITORY_LAYER_DOWN_PROTOCOL.md
- Action: Consumer repos must align to AIMC gateway pattern before adding AI features
- Tracking: Will be tracked via ripple log when layer-down executed

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: No gaps detected — all governance artifacts aligned
- Completeness: CANON_INVENTORY, CHANGELOG, GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY all synchronized

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: Clean — no placeholder hashes, no orphaned references, all cross-references valid
- Inventory integrity: CANON_INVENTORY total_canons matches actual count (178)
- Hash integrity: Full SHA256 hash recorded (dfe539fe290148e6e7c9112fa269b5cd0124c456954de1d75c9a7870cd79b2dc)

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

**Summary**: Successfully canonized AIMC Strategy as governance/canon/AIMC_STRATEGY.md v1.0.0 with full governance integration. All inventories updated, CHANGELOG entry created, cross-references established, and session memory captured.

**Deliverables**:
1. ✅ AIMC_STRATEGY.md created (22,661 chars, SHA256: dfe539fe...)
2. ✅ CANON_INVENTORY.json updated (178 canons)
3. ✅ CHANGELOG.md updated (full entry with migration guidance)
4. ✅ GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md updated
5. ✅ COGNITIVE_CAPABILITY_ORCHESTRATION_MODEL.md cross-referenced
6. ✅ THREE_TIER_AGENT_KNOWLEDGE_ARCHITECTURE.md cross-referenced
7. ✅ Session memory created (this file)

**Next Steps**:
- Layer-down ripple to maturion-isms repository required (per CROSS_REPOSITORY_LAYER_DOWN_PROTOCOL.md)
- Consumer repos must implement AIMC gateway before adding AI features (constitutional constraint)

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
1. **Python for large JSON updates**: Using Python script for CANON_INVENTORY.json update avoided jq file corruption issue with 98KB file
2. **Source provenance verification**: Found original strategy file and verified PR #1182 commit hash for accurate provenance
3. **Comprehensive exploration**: Checking related canons first prevented overlap and enabled proper cross-referencing
4. **Alphabetical ordering**: GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY maintains strict alphabetical order; inserting between AGENT_SELF_GOVERNANCE and APP_STARTUP was correct
5. **Full SHA256 hashes**: Calculated and recorded complete hash (not truncated) per CANON_INVENTORY_INTEGRITY_REQUIREMENTS.md

### What Was Challenging
1. **Large JSON file handling**: Initial jq attempt failed with 98KB CANON_INVENTORY.json; had to restore from git and use Python
2. **Finding integration points**: Had to search multiple files to find where cross-references belonged (Integration vs Related Canon sections)
3. **Namespace separation emphasis**: Needed to reinforce build agents vs app personas distinction in multiple places to prevent future confusion

### What Future Sessions Should Know
1. **Use Python for CANON_INVENTORY.json updates**: jq fails with files > ~50KB; Python json module is safer
2. **Always verify PR provenance**: git log with grep for PR number (1182) confirms commit hash and merge details
3. **Cross-reference pattern**: COGNITIVE_CAPABILITY_ORCHESTRATION_MODEL uses "Integration:" field; THREE_TIER_AGENT_KNOWLEDGE_ARCHITECTURE uses "Related Canon" section
4. **CHANGELOG format**: Use [VERSION/ID] format, include SHA256 for new files, document migration guidance even if "NO" migration required
5. **Session memory is last step**: Create after all work complete, not during (captures full context and outcome)

### Governance Insights
1. **Canon creation is constitutional event**: Not just documentation — creates binding authority that consumer repos must follow
2. **Namespace separation is critical**: Build agents vs runtime app personas must never be confused; governance enforces this architecturally
3. **Ripple awareness**: Canon changes trigger layer-down ripple obligations; must be tracked and executed separately
4. **Provider abstraction is governance principle**: AIMC enforces capability-based abstraction (never provider/model names) as constitutional rule
5. **Memory centralization is constitutional**: AIMC Memory Centre implements MEMORY_INTEGRITY_AND_CORRUPTION_MODEL.md for application layer
6. **Phase sequencing prevents chaos**: 6-phase build sequence ensures modules don't add AI features before infrastructure ready
