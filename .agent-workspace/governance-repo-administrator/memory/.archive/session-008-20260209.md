# Session 008 - 20260209 (Living Agent System v5.0.0)

## Task
Create FM Merge Gate Management Protocol and Applicability Matrix as governance canon to address gate misalignment and role misapplication issues in consumer repositories.

## What I Did

### Files Created (Auto-populated)
  - governance/canon/FM_MERGE_GATE_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md (v1.0.0, 22KB)
  - governance/canon/MERGE_GATE_APPLICABILITY_MATRIX.md (v1.0.0, 23KB)

### Files Modified (Auto-populated)
  - governance/canon/MERGE_GATE_PHILOSOPHY.md (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0)
  - GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md (added 3 entries)
  - governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json (124 → 127 canons)
  - .agent-workspace/governance-repo-administrator/ripple-log.md

### Inventory Updates
- GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md: Updated with 3 new/updated entries
- CANON_INVENTORY.json: Updated with 3 canon entries, total_canons: 127

### Canon Changes
- Canon modified: Yes - 2 new canon files created, 1 updated
- Canon files created:
  - FM_MERGE_GATE_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md (v1.0.0, PUBLIC_API)
  - MERGE_GATE_APPLICABILITY_MATRIX.md (v1.0.0, PUBLIC_API)
- Canon files updated:
  - MERGE_GATE_PHILOSOPHY.md (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0, PUBLIC_API)

## Living Agent System v5.0.0 Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: .agent-workspace/governance-repo-administrator/evidence-20260209.log
- Status: 153 evidence entries collected

### Ripple Status
- Status: Ripple executed - See ripple-log.md
- Ripple executed: Yes
- Consumer repos notified: maturion-foreman-office-app, PartPulse, R_Roster
- Ripple timestamp: 2026-02-09 11:32 UTC
- Files to layer down: 3 (all PUBLIC_API)

### Governance Gap Progress (Issue #1047)
- Status: Significant progress - FM merge gate management gap closed
- Gap files created: 2 new comprehensive protocols
- Integration: Complete with existing gate canon

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: No hygiene issues detected
- Duplicates/conflicts/legacy: None introduced
- Canonical cross-references: All validated

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

Successfully created comprehensive FM merge gate management governance canon:
- Established FM autonomous authority for gate alignment within defined bounds
- Created authoritative gate-to-role applicability matrix
- Added comprehensive governance compliance checklists
- Integrated with existing canon (6 primary dependencies)
- Executed governance ripple to 3 consumer repositories
- All quality checks passed (code review, canonical validation)

## Lessons

### What Worked
- Systematic review of existing merge gate canon before creating new protocols
- Clear delineation of FM autonomous authority vs. escalation requirements
- Comprehensive applicability matrix eliminates gate misapplication ambiguity
- Governance compliance checklists provide actionable implementation guidance
- Living Agent System v5.0.0 protocols (wake-up, evidence collection, ripple) ensured thoroughness

### What Was Challenging
- Balancing FM autonomy with constitutional safeguards
- Ensuring no enforcement weakening while fixing misalignments
- Creating exhaustive gate-to-role matrix without omissions
- Integrating with 6+ existing canonical documents coherently

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- FM_MERGE_GATE_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md defines fix vs. escalation decision matrix (Section 5)
- MERGE_GATE_APPLICABILITY_MATRIX.md is authoritative source for gate applicability (Section 5.2)
- MERGE_GATE_PHILOSOPHY.md now includes comprehensive compliance checklist (after Section 7)
- All 3 files are PUBLIC_API and require layer-down to consumer repos
- Governance ripple documented in ripple-log.md with detailed impact assessment
