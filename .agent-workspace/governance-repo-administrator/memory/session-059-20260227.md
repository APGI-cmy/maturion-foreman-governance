# Session 059 - 20260227 (Living Agent System v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: governance-repo-administrator
- Class: administrator
- Session ID: 059

## Task
Update governance admin agent file and align all artifacts with canonical format from maturion-isms reference files (foreman-v2-agent.md and governance-liaison-isms-agent.md). Issue: [Governance] Codex Advisor: Update governance admin agent file and artifact alignment.

## What I Did

### Files Modified
- `.github/agents/governance-repo-administrator-v2.agent.md` — Updated YAML frontmatter to canonical format (S1 gates compliance); added AGENT_RUNTIME_DIRECTIVE blockquote; removed inlined Tier 2 content (detailed requirement mappings + session memory protocol); added canonical Tier 2 reference footer.
- `.agent-workspace/governance-repo-administrator/knowledge/index.md` — Expanded with comprehensive knowledge index including Tier-3 canon references and new session-memory-template.md entry.
- `governance/agents/governance-administrator.agent.md` — Added deprecation notice directing to canonical contract location.
- `governance/AGENT_REGISTRY.json` — Registered governance-repo-administrator-v2 agent (previously total_agents: 0).

### Files Created
- `.agent-workspace/governance-repo-administrator/knowledge/session-memory-template.md` — Moved session memory template, PREHANDOVER proof template, and escalation template from agent body to Tier 2 knowledge.
- `.agent-workspace/governance-repo-administrator/memory/session-059-20260227.md` — This file.
- `.agent-workspace/governance-repo-administrator/memory/PREHANDOVER-session-059-20260227.md` — PREHANDOVER proof for this session.

### Decisions Made
- Decision 1: Aligned YAML frontmatter with canonical format from maturion-isms reference files (foreman-v2-agent.md, governance-liaison-isms-agent.md). Added all S1 gate requirements: name, contract_pattern, governance.version, canon_home, this_copy, policy_refs, execution_identity.safety, iaa_oversight, identity block, parity_enforcement, approval_required, escalation with halt_conditions, structured prohibitions, tier2_knowledge.
- Decision 2: Removed "DETAILED REQUIREMENT MAPPINGS" section and "After Work Completes" session memory protocol section from agent body — these are Tier 2 content (violates S2-07 gate). Moved templates to `.agent-workspace/governance-repo-administrator/knowledge/session-memory-template.md`.
- Decision 3: Deprecated `governance/agents/governance-administrator.agent.md` with a notice pointing to the canonical `.github/agents/governance-repo-administrator-v2.agent.md`. This file was an old-format documentation artifact, not a proper agent contract.
- Decision 4: Registered governance-repo-administrator-v2 in `governance/AGENT_REGISTRY.json` to address third-tier traceability gap (registry had total_agents: 0).

## Living Agent System Evidence

### CANON_INVENTORY Status
- Status: CLEAN (no changes to CANON_INVENTORY in this session)
- Hash check: PASS (no modifications to constitutional canon)

### Ripple Status
- Ripple required: NO (no constitutional canon changes made)
- Status: NOT_REQUIRED

### Governance Gap Progress
- Agent YAML frontmatter non-compliance with S1 gates: RESOLVED
- Missing AGENT_RUNTIME_DIRECTIVE (S2-01 gate): RESOLVED
- Inlined Tier 2 content (S2-07 gate violation): RESOLVED
- Empty AGENT_REGISTRY.json (total_agents: 0): RESOLVED
- Legacy governance-administrator.agent.md without deprecation: RESOLVED
- Minimal knowledge index (only FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md): RESOLVED

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: governance-administrator.agent.md was in old format without proper YAML frontmatter — deprecated.

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Reference examples from maturion-isms (foreman-v2-agent.md and governance-liaison-isms-agent.md) provided clear canonical format to align to.
- The agent-file-non-negotiables-checklist.md provided a precise S1/S2 gate list to work through systematically.
- Removing inlined Tier 2 content (detailed requirement mappings) freed up space within the 30,000 char limit while making the contract cleaner.

### What Was Challenging
- The agent file was already very close to the 30,000 char limit (29,644 chars) before changes, requiring removal of verbose sections to accommodate the new required YAML fields.

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- The governance-repo-administrator-v2 agent now complies with the canonical YAML format (S1 gates) and has the AGENT_RUNTIME_DIRECTIVE (S2-01 gate).
- Tier 2 knowledge is at `.agent-workspace/governance-repo-administrator/knowledge/` and includes session-memory-template.md.
- The AGENT_REGISTRY.json now registers this agent (total_agents: 1).

### Governance Insights
- The gap between the agent file format in this repo and the canonical format in maturion-isms was significant, spanning 10+ YAML fields. Regular alignment checks against canonical reference files are important.

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)
No degradation observed. Continuous improvement note: An ADMINISTRATOR_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md does not yet exist in `governance/checklists/` — only builder, foreman, liaison, orchestrator, specialist, and platform-AI checklists exist. Creating an administrator-specific checklist would provide clearer guidance for administrator agent alignment audits.
