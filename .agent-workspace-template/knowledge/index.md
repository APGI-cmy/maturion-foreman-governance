**Instructions for new agents**: Replace `[AGENT_NAME]` with the actual agent name. Add additional Tier 2 knowledge documents as the agent accumulates domain-specific operational knowledge. All Tier 2 documents must be listed here. See `THREE_TIER_AGENT_KNOWLEDGE_ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full Tier 2 requirements.
