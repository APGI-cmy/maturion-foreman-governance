## Context
- Issue: N/A
- Purpose: Layer-up TRS Stage Governance from maturion-isms to canonical governance repository

## Actions Taken

## Decisions Made

- Created new governance/strategy directory as it did not exist
- Classified change as MODERATE BREAKING with backward compatibility
- Used PUBLIC_API layer_down_status for all new governance files

## Lessons Learned

- SHA256 checksum validation ensured file integrity
- Layer-up protocol from maturion-isms was well documented

## Patterns Observed

- Layer-up protocol enables evidence-based governance evolution
- Breaking changes can maintain backward compatibility
